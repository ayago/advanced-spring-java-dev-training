# Security Through Spring Security: Authentication and Authorization

In the context of system security, Spring Security provides robust mechanisms for both **Authentication** and **Authorization** to protect applications from unauthorized access and ensure that resources are only accessible to permitted users. These two aspects, while closely related, serve different purposes in the overall security strategy of an application.

## Authentication

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system attempting to access an application. It answers the question: "Who are you?" This is typically the first step in any secure transaction or access control flow. 

From a systems security perspective, authentication is critical because it ensures that only legitimate users can access the system. This process can involve various methods, such as passwords, biometrics, one-time PINs, or authentication apps. Multi-factor authentication (MFA), which combines multiple types of these methods, is often used to increase security levels further. Spring Security provides a flexible and extensible framework to handle various authentication methods, integrating with identity providers and supporting industry standards like OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and SAML.

## Authorization

**Authorization** is the process that comes after authentication and determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It answers the question: "What can you do?" Authorization checks ensure that users can only access the resources they have permissions for and perform allowed actions based on their roles or attributes.

In the context of systems security, authorization plays a key role in enforcing policies that restrict access to sensitive data or functionalities. Authorization decisions are usually based on settings maintained by security teams, such as role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC). These settings dictate which users or user groups are granted or denied access to certain parts of the application. Spring Security facilitates this by offering various ways to define and enforce security rules, including annotations, method-level security, and URL-based security configurations.

| **Authentication:** Verifies credentials      | Through passwords, biometrics, one-time pins, or apps                             | Yes                         |
| **Authorization:** Grants or denies permissions | Through settings maintained by security teams                                      | No                          |
