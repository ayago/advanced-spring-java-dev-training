# Architecture Patterns

Architecture patterns in software development are high-level strategies for solving common design challenges in system architecture. These patterns provide a blueprint for structuring software systems, ensuring they are scalable, maintainable, and robust. Unlike design patterns, which address specific code-level issues, architecture patterns address the broader structure and interaction between components within a system.

**Key Characteristics**

* High-Level Design: Focus on the organization and interaction of major components.
* Scalability and Performance: Consideration of how the system will perform and scale under load.
* Maintainability: Ensure that the system can be easily maintained and extended.
* Reusability: Encourage the reuse of components or services across different parts of the system.
* Separation of Concerns: Divide the system into distinct sections, each responsible for a specific concern.

## Layered Pattern

**Intent:**
The Layered Pattern, also known as the N-tier architecture, is designed to organize the components of an application into horizontal layers, each with a specific responsibility. This separation of concerns allows for more modular and maintainable code.

**When to Use:**
- When building applications that require a clear separation of concerns.
- When the application needs to be scalable, maintainable, and testable.
- When developing enterprise applications where each layer can be developed and maintained independently.

**Components Involved:**
1. **Presentation Layer (UI):** Handles user interface and user interaction.
2. **Application Layer (Service):** Manages application logic and communication between the UI and other layers.
3. **Business Logic Layer (Domain):** Contains the core functionality and business rules of the application.
4. **Data Access Layer (Persistence):** Manages data storage and retrieval, typically interacting with databases.
5. **Database Layer:** The actual database or data source where the applicationâ€™s data resides.

**Real-World Usage:**
- **ECommerce Systems:** Where the UI handles user interactions, the business logic manages product selection and purchasing rules, and the data access layer interacts with the database.
- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems:** Which require clear separations between the different modules, such as finance, HR, and inventory management.

**Pros:**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer handles a specific part of the application, leading to more maintainable and testable code.
- **Modularity:** Layers can be developed, updated, and replaced independently.
- **Scalability:** Each layer can be scaled separately, depending on the load.

**Cons:**
- **Performance Overhead:** Multiple layers can introduce latency as data passes through each layer.
- **Complexity:** Managing dependencies and communication between layers can be complex, especially in large systems.
- **Rigidity:** Changes in one layer can sometimes require changes in others, making the architecture less flexible.
