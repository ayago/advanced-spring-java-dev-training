# Synchronous Communication in Microservices

Synchronous communication involves a direct request-response interaction between services where the caller waits for a response from the callee before continuing its execution. Typically, this is implemented using HTTP REST or gRPC, where one service calls another and expects a timely reply.

## Example: Synchronous REST Communication

Let's assume two microservices: `OrderService` and `PaymentService`. The `OrderService` needs to validate payment before confirming an order.

**Code:**

1. **OrderService** sends a request to **PaymentService**.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/orders")
public class OrderController {

    private final WebClient webClient;

    @Autowired
    public OrderController(WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder) {
        this.webClient = webClientBuilder.baseUrl("http://localhost:8081").build();
    }

    @PostMapping("/placeOrder")
    public ResponseEntity<String> placeOrder(@RequestBody OrderRequest orderRequest) {
        try {
            // Call PaymentService synchronously
            PaymentResponse paymentResponse = webClient.post()
                .uri("/payments/validate")
                .bodyValue(orderRequest.getPaymentInfo())
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(PaymentResponse.class)
                .block();  // Blocking call to make it synchronous

            if (paymentResponse != null && paymentResponse.isValid()) {
                return ResponseEntity.ok("Order placed successfully!");
            } else {
                return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body("Payment validation failed.");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body("An error occurred while validating payment.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Note - What Is the WebClient?**

Simply put, WebClient is an interface representing the main entry point for performing web requests.

It was created as part of the Spring Web Reactive module and will be replacing the classic RestTemplate in these scenarios. In addition, the new client is a reactive, non-blocking solution that works over the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Itâ€™s important to note that even though it is, in fact, a non-blocking client and it belongs to the spring-webflux library, the solution offers support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations, making it suitable also for applications running on a Servlet Stack.

2. **PaymentService** processes the payment validation request.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/payments")
public class PaymentController {
    
    @PostMapping("/validate")
    public PaymentResponse validatePayment(@RequestBody PaymentInfo paymentInfo) {
        // Mock payment validation logic
        boolean isValid = paymentInfo.getCardNumber().startsWith("4"); // Assume valid if card number starts with "4"
        return new PaymentResponse(isValid);
    }
}
```

## Explanation:

- **OrderService** makes a synchronous HTTP call to **PaymentService** using `RestTemplate`. The `OrderService` waits for the response before proceeding with order confirmation.
- If **PaymentService** successfully validates the payment, it returns a success response, and **OrderService** confirms the order.

### An example using Project Reactor

The dependency is reactive

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/orders")
public class OrderController {

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    @PostMapping("/placeOrder")
    public ResponseEntity<String> placeOrder(@RequestBody OrderRequest orderRequest) {
        // Call PaymentService
        ResponseEntity<PaymentResponse> paymentResponse = restTemplate.postForEntity(
            "http://localhost:8081/payments/validate", orderRequest.getPaymentInfo(), PaymentResponse.class
        );

        if (paymentResponse.getStatusCode() == HttpStatus.OK && paymentResponse.getBody().isValid()) {
            return ResponseEntity.ok("Order placed successfully!");
        } else {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body("Payment validation failed.");
        }
    }
}

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/payments")
public class PaymentController {

    @PostMapping("/validate")
    public Mono<PaymentResponse> validatePayment(@RequestBody PaymentInfo paymentInfo) {
        // Mock payment validation logic
        boolean isValid = paymentInfo.getCardNumber().startsWith("4"); // Assume valid if card number starts with "4"
        return Mono.just(new PaymentResponse(isValid));
    }
}

```

## Trade-offs:

**Pros:**

1. **Simple to Implement:** Straightforward to set up using REST or gRPC. Most developers are familiar with HTTP-based communication.
2. **Consistent State Management:** Easier to maintain consistency as the caller waits for a response to determine the next action.
3. **Error Handling:** Immediate handling of errors and retries can be implemented directly.

**Cons:**

1. **Tight Coupling:** Services become tightly coupled, as the caller relies directly on the callee's availability and response time.
2. **Scalability Issues:** If the callee service is slow or down, it impacts the caller's performance, potentially leading to a cascading failure.
3. **Latency:** Increased latency due to the wait time for the response, which could degrade the overall system performance, especially under high load.
