# Data Sharing in Microservices

Data Sharing in microservices involves strategies to enable services to exchange data. Since microservices promote autonomy and encapsulation, sharing data effectively without tightly coupling services is a challenge. There are multiple ways to achieve data sharing, such as using shared databases, data replication, or event-driven architectures.

## Event-Driven Data Sharing

In an eCommerce system, when an `OrderService` confirms an order, it publishes an `OrderConfirmed` event. The `InventoryService` subscribes to this event to update stock levels, while the `NotificationService` listens to the same event to notify the customer.

- **OrderService** publishes `OrderConfirmed` event.
- **InventoryService** consumes the event to update stock.
- **NotificationService** consumes the event to notify customers.

**Code Example**

```java
// OrderService.java
public class OrderService {
    private final ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher;

    public OrderService(ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher) {
        this.eventPublisher = eventPublisher;
    }

    public void confirmOrder(Order order) {
        // Order confirmation logic
        eventPublisher.publishEvent(new OrderConfirmedEvent(order.getId()));
    }
}

// InventoryService.java
@Service
public class InventoryService {
    @EventListener
    public void handleOrderConfirmed(OrderConfirmedEvent event) {
        // Logic to update inventory based on the order details
    }
}

// NotificationService.java
@Service
public class NotificationService {
    @EventListener
    public void handleOrderConfirmed(OrderConfirmedEvent event) {
        // Logic to send notifications to the customer
    }
}

// OrderConfirmedEvent.java
public class OrderConfirmedEvent {
    private final String orderId;

    public OrderConfirmedEvent(String orderId) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
    }

    public String getOrderId() {
        return orderId;
    }
}
```

- **OrderService** publishes an event when an order is confirmed.
- **InventoryService** and **NotificationService** listen to this event asynchronously.
- This approach decouples the services, allowing them to evolve independently while still sharing necessary data.

**Trade-offs**

Pros:
- **Loose Coupling**: Services remain independent; changes in one service do not directly affect others.
- **Scalability**: Services can scale independently based on their specific load.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add or remove consumers without affecting the producer.

Cons:
- **Eventual Consistency**: Since data sharing is asynchronous, services may not have immediate consistency.
- **Complexity**: Requires a robust event-driven system and handling of eventual consistency challenges.
- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Harder to track and debug issues across multiple services.

## Shared Database

A shared database approach involves multiple microservices accessing the same database schema or data storage. This strategy ensures that all services have immediate access to the most up-to-date data without additional synchronization mechanisms. However, it contradicts the microservices principle of data encapsulation and autonomy.

**Example: Using a Shared Database in an E-Commerce Platform**

In an eCommerce platform, both `OrderService` and `InventoryService` directly access a shared database that stores information about products, orders, and stock levels. When an order is placed, the `OrderService` updates the order table, and the `InventoryService` simultaneously adjusts the stock levels using the same database.

**Code Example**

```java
// OrderService.java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    public OrderService(JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate) {
        this.jdbcTemplate = jdbcTemplate;
    }

    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        // Insert order details into the shared database
        jdbcTemplate.update("INSERT INTO orders (order_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                order.getId(), order.getProductId(), order.getQuantity());
        
        // Update inventory in the shared database
        jdbcTemplate.update("UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - ? WHERE product_id = ?",
                order.getQuantity(), order.getProductId());
    }
}
```

- **OrderService** interacts directly with the shared database to both place an order and update inventory.
- No explicit communication is required between services since all relevant data is maintained in a common data store.

**Trade-offs**

Pros:
- **Immediate Consistency**: Data is consistent across services because they operate on the same dataset.
- **Simplicity**: Reduces the need for complex data synchronization or messaging systems.

Cons:
- **Tight Coupling**: Changes in the database schema affect all services using it.
- **Scalability Issues**: The shared database can become a bottleneck under high loads.
- **Reduced Autonomy**: Services lose their independence by relying on a single data source.

## Data Replication

Data replication involves copying data from one service to another to ensure each service has its own local copy of the data it needs. This method is used to reduce latency, increase availability, and maintain service autonomy, but it introduces challenges around data consistency and synchronization.

**Example: Using Data Replication in an E-Commerce Platform**

In an eCommerce platform, `OrderService` maintains its own database for order management, while `InventoryService` maintains a separate database for inventory management. When an order is placed, `OrderService` replicates relevant data to the `InventoryService` to update stock levels. 

**Code Example**

```java
// OrderService.java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final InventoryClient inventoryClient;
    private final OrderRepository orderRepository;

    public OrderService(InventoryClient inventoryClient, OrderRepository orderRepository) {
        this.inventoryClient = inventoryClient;
        this.orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }

    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        // Save order in OrderService database
        orderRepository.save(order);
        
        // Replicate relevant data to InventoryService
        inventoryClient.updateInventory(order.getProductId(), order.getQuantity());
    }
}

// InventoryClient.java
@Service
public class InventoryClient {
    private final RestTemplate restTemplate;

    public InventoryClient(RestTemplate restTemplate) {
        this.restTemplate = restTemplate;
    }

    public void updateInventory(String productId, int quantity) {
        restTemplate.postForEntity("http://inventory-service/update", new InventoryUpdateRequest(productId, quantity), Void.class);
    }
}
```

- **OrderService** keeps its own database for orders and replicates data to **InventoryService** via a REST API to update inventory.
- Data replication ensures that both services maintain their autonomy while keeping their respective databases updated.

**Trade-offs**

Pros:
- **Service Autonomy**: Each service owns its data, allowing for independent scaling, maintenance, and deployment.
- **Improved Performance**: Local data access reduces latency, especially for read-heavy services.
- **Fault Isolation**: If one service fails, others can continue functioning with their local data.

Cons:
- **Data Inconsistency**: Risk of data becoming out-of-sync due to replication delays or failures.
- **Complexity**: Requires a reliable mechanism to handle synchronization, conflict resolution, and eventual consistency.
- **Increased Storage Costs**: Duplicate data storage can increase overall storage requirements.
