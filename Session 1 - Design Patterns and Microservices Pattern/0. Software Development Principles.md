# Software Development Principles

## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**Java Example:**

```java
// Before SRP: Class handling multiple responsibilities
class Invoice {
    void calculateTotal() { /* ... */ }
    void printInvoice() { /* ... */ }
    void saveToDatabase() { /* ... */ }
}

// After SRP: Separate classes for each responsibility
class Invoice {
    void calculateTotal() { /* ... */ }
}

class InvoicePrinter {
    void printInvoice(Invoice invoice) { /* ... */ }
}

class InvoiceRepository {
    void save(Invoice invoice) { /* ... */ }
}
```

**Consequences of Not Following SRP:**
- **Increased Complexity:** The class becomes complex with multiple responsibilities, making it harder to understand and maintain.
- **Difficult to Modify:** Changes in one responsibility may affect others, causing unintended side effects and making the class brittle.
- **Harder to Test:** Testing becomes more challenging as multiple responsibilities need to be verified together.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Java Example:**

```java
// Before OCP: Modifying the existing class to add new functionality
class PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(String type) {
        if (type.equals("CreditCard")) {
            // process credit card payment
        } else if (type.equals("PayPal")) {
            // process PayPal payment
        }
    }
}

// After OCP: Extending the functionality without modifying the existing class
abstract class Payment {
    abstract void process();
}

class CreditCardPayment extends Payment {
    void process() { /* ... */ }
}

class PayPalPayment extends Payment {
    void process() { /* ... */ }
}

class PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(Payment payment) {
        payment.process();
    }
}
```

**Consequences of Not Following OCP:**
- **Fragile Code:** Modifications to existing code can introduce bugs and unintended side effects.
- **Tight Coupling:** Classes become tightly coupled to specific implementations, reducing flexibility and increasing maintenance costs.
- **Difficulty in Extending:** Adding new features requires modifying existing code, which can lead to increased risk of errors.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Java Example:**

```java
// Before LSP: Subclass violates the behavior expected by the superclass
class Bird {
    void fly() { /* ... */ }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
    void fly() { 
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostrich can't fly");
    }
}

// After LSP: Separate classes to ensure correct behavior
class Bird { }

class FlyingBird extends Bird {
    void fly() { /* ... */ }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird { /* Ostrich-specific methods */ }
```

**Consequences of Not Following LSP:**
- **Unexpected Behavior:** Subclasses can introduce unexpected behaviors, leading to runtime errors and instability.
- **Difficult to Refactor:** Refactoring code becomes challenging if subclasses do not conform to expected behaviors.
- **Reduced Reusability:** Code relying on the superclass may not work correctly with subclasses, reducing the reusability of code.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use. Instead, multiple specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

**Java Example:**

```java
// Before ISP: One general interface with methods not needed by all clients
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
}

class HumanWorker implements Worker {
    public void work() { /* ... */ }
    public void eat() { /* ... */ }
}

class RobotWorker implements Worker {
    public void work() { /* ... */ }
    public void eat() { 
        // Not applicable for robots
    }
}

// After ISP: Separate interfaces for specific behaviors
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

class HumanWorker implements Workable, Eatable {
    public void work() { /* ... */ }
    public void eat() { /* ... */ }
}

class RobotWorker implements Workable {
    public void work() { /* ... */ }
}
```

**Consequences of Not Following ISP:**
- **Unnecessary Implementations:** Clients are forced to implement methods they do not need, leading to unnecessary code and complexity.
- **Increased Coupling:** Changes to the interface may force changes in clients that do not require the new functionality.
- **Difficult to Maintain:** Large interfaces can become cumbersome to maintain and evolve.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

**Java Example:**

```java
// Before DIP: High-level module depends on a low-level module
class Lamp {
    void turnOn() { /* ... */ }
}

class Switch {
    private Lamp lamp;
    Switch(Lamp lamp) {
        this.lamp = lamp;
    }
    void operate() {
        lamp.turnOn();
    }
}

// After DIP: High-level module depends on an abstraction
interface Switchable {
    void turnOn();
}

class Lamp implements Switchable {
    public void turnOn() { /* ... */ }
}

class Switch {
    private Switchable device;
    Switch(Switchable device) {
        this.device = device;
    }
    void operate() {
        device.turnOn();
    }
}
```

**Consequences of Not Following DIP:**
- **Tight Coupling:** High-level modules become tightly coupled to low-level modules, reducing flexibility and making the system harder to change.
- **Difficulty in Testing:** Testing high-level modules becomes challenging as they are dependent on concrete implementations.
- **Increased Rigidity:** Changes in low-level modules require modifications in high-level modules, leading to a brittle codebase.


## YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
YAGNI is a principle of extreme programming that states you should not add functionality until it is necessary. In other words, don’t implement something until it is required.

**Java Example:**

```java
// Before YAGNI: Implementing a complex feature that is not yet needed
class ReportGenerator {
    void generateReport(String format) {
        if (format.equals("PDF")) {
            // Generate PDF report
        } else if (format.equals("Excel")) {
            // Generate Excel report
        } else if (format.equals("CSV")) {
            // Generate CSV report
        }
    }
}

// After YAGNI: Implementing only what is necessary
class ReportGenerator {
    void generateReport(String format) {
        if (format.equals("PDF")) {
            // Generate PDF report
        }
    }
}
```

**Consequences of Not Following YAGNI:**
- **Increased Complexity:** Adding features that are not yet needed increases the complexity of the codebase, making it harder to understand and maintain.
- **Wasted Effort:** Time and resources are spent developing features that may never be used, leading to inefficiency.
- **Potential for Bugs:** Implementing unused features can introduce bugs and create additional maintenance overhead.
- **Overengineering:** The code can become overengineered with unnecessary abstractions and components, reducing clarity and simplicity.


## KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
The KISS principle advocates for simplicity in design and implementation. It emphasizes that systems and solutions should be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Java Example:**

```java
// Before KISS: Overcomplicated implementation
class User {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private int age;
    private String email;
    private String phoneNumber;

    // Complex constructor
    User(String firstName, String lastName, int age, String email, String phoneNumber) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.age = age;
        this.email = email;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
    }

    // Overcomplicated method
    boolean validateUserDetails() {
        if (firstName.isEmpty() || lastName.isEmpty()) {
            return false;
        }
        if (age < 0 || age > 150) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!email.contains("@") || !phoneNumber.matches("\\d{10}")) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

// After KISS: Simplified implementation
class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    User(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    boolean isValid() {
        return !name.isEmpty() && age >= 0 && age <= 150;
    }
}
```

**Consequences of Not Following KISS:**
- **Increased Complexity:** Adding unnecessary complexity makes the code harder to read, understand, and maintain.
- **Higher Risk of Bugs:** Complex code is more prone to errors and bugs, which can be difficult to debug and fix.
- **Longer Development Time:** Overly complex solutions take more time to develop, test, and deploy.
- **Reduced Flexibility:** Complex designs are harder to modify or extend, reducing the overall flexibility of the system.

Certainly! Here’s the Markdown documentation for the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, including a description, consequences of not following it, and a sample Java code:


## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
The DRY principle emphasizes that code duplication should be avoided. Instead, code should be abstracted into reusable components to promote maintainability and reduce redundancy.

**Java Example:**

```java
// Before DRY: Code duplication
class ReportGenerator {
    void generatePDFReport(String content) {
        // Generate PDF report
        System.out.println("Generating PDF report with content: " + content);
    }

    void generateExcelReport(String content) {
        // Generate Excel report
        System.out.println("Generating Excel report with content: " + content);
    }
}

// After DRY: Reusable method
class ReportGenerator {
    void generateReport(String format, String content) {
        // Generate report based on format
        System.out.println("Generating " + format + " report with content: " + content);
    }
}
```

**Consequences of Not Following DRY:**
- **Increased Maintenance Effort:** Duplicate code means that changes need to be made in multiple places, increasing the risk of inconsistencies and errors.
- **Higher Risk of Bugs:** Redundant code can lead to discrepancies between different parts of the system if not updated simultaneously.
- **Reduced Code Clarity:** Repetitive code makes the system harder to read and understand, reducing overall code clarity.
- **Difficulty in Refactoring:** Code duplication makes refactoring more challenging, as changes must be applied in multiple locations.

## WET (Write Everything Twice)
Reverse of DRY. Do not follow.

## Separation of Concerns (SoC)
The Separation of Concerns principle advocates for dividing a system into distinct sections, each addressing a specific concern or functionality. This approach helps in managing complexity by isolating different parts of the system, making it easier to maintain and modify.

**Java Example:**

```java
// Before SoC: Mixing concerns within a single class
class UserManager {
    void createUser(String username, String password) {
        // Save user to database
        // Send confirmation email
        // Log the creation event
    }
}

// After SoC: Separation into distinct classes
class UserManager {
    private UserRepository userRepository;
    private EmailService emailService;
    private Logger logger;

    UserManager(UserRepository userRepository, EmailService emailService, Logger logger) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
        this.emailService = emailService;
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    void createUser(String username, String password) {
        userRepository.save(username, password);
        emailService.sendConfirmationEmail(username);
        logger.log("User created: " + username);
    }
}

class UserRepository {
    void save(String username, String password) { /* ... */ }
}

class EmailService {
    void sendConfirmationEmail(String username) { /* ... */ }
}

class Logger {
    void log(String message) { /* ... */ }
}
```

**Consequences of Not Following SoC:**
- **Increased Complexity:** Mixing multiple concerns in a single component makes it harder to understand and maintain.
- **Difficulty in Modifying:** Changes to one concern can unintentionally affect others, making modifications risky and error-prone.
- **Reduced Reusability:** Components become tightly coupled with other concerns, reducing their reusability in different contexts.
- **Challenging Testing:** Testing becomes more complex as different concerns are intertwined, requiring more extensive and complex test cases.
