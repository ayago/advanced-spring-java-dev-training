# Service Mesh

The service mesh serves as a powerful design pattern that abstracts the underlying network infrastructure, providing a standardized solution by deploying sidecar proxies alongside your services. These proxies, often leveraging technologies like the Envoy proxy, handle critical networking tasks, security enforcement, and observability.

By incorporating a service mesh, you can streamline your operational processes significantly. Service developers no longer need to invest excessive time and effort. Here are some features provided by service mesh.

- Load Balancing
- Observability
- Security
- Service discovery
- Retry of failed requests
- Circuit breaking
- Multi-tenancy
- Optimized communication
- Improved reliability
