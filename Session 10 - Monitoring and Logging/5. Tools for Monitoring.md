# Tools for Monitoring

## 1. Prometheus

### Overview

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects and stores metrics as time series data, making it suitable for monitoring applications and systems.

### Key Features

- **Time Series Data**: Prometheus stores metrics as time series data.
- **Powerful Query Language**: PromQL for querying and analyzing metrics.
- **Pull Model**: Prometheus scrapes metrics from configured endpoints.

### Integration with Spring Boot

To integrate Prometheus with Spring Boot, you can use the `micrometer-registry-prometheus` library.

#### Maven Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Configuration

In your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "*"
  metrics:
    export:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
```

Prometheus will scrape metrics from the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint by default.

## 2. Grafana

### Overview

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It provides beautiful visualizations and dashboards for your metrics.

### Key Features

- **Dashboards**: Customizable dashboards for visualizing metrics.
- **Data Sources**: Integrates with Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, and others.
- **Alerting**: Supports alerting based on metrics thresholds.

### Integration with Spring Boot and Prometheus

1. **Add Prometheus Data Source in Grafana**:
   - Navigate to Grafana's web interface.
   - Go to **Configuration** > **Data Sources** > **Add data source**.
   - Select **Prometheus** and configure the URL to your Prometheus server.

2. **Create Dashboards**:
   - Create new dashboards to visualize metrics collected by Prometheus.

## 3. Jaeger

### Overview

Jaeger is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing system that helps with performance optimization and debugging of microservices.

### Key Features

- **Distributed Context Propagation**: Traces requests across services.
- **Visualization**: Provides detailed insights into request flows.
- **Scalability**: Designed for high throughput and large-scale systems.

### Integration with Spring Boot

To integrate Jaeger with Spring Boot, you can use the `opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger` library.

#### Maven Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Configuration

Configure OpenTelemetry in your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

```yaml
otel:
  traces:
    exporter:
      jaeger:
        endpoint: http://localhost:14250
        service-name: your-service-name
```

## 4. Zipkin

### Overview

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system that helps collect and visualize traces of requests across microservices.

### Key Features

- **Trace Collection**: Collects and visualizes trace data.
- **Latency Analysis**: Identifies bottlenecks and performance issues.
- **Integration**: Works with Spring Boot and other microservices frameworks.

### Integration with Spring Boot

To integrate Zipkin with Spring Boot, you can use the `spring-cloud-starter-zipkin` library.

#### Maven Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Configuration

In your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  zipkin:
    base-url: http://localhost:9411
```
