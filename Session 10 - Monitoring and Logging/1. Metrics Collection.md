# Metrics Collection

Monitoring is a critical aspect of microservices architecture, ensuring that system health and performance are constantly tracked. One key element of monitoring is **metrics collection**—quantifiable data about the health and performance of applications and infrastructure. 

## Key Considerations for Metrics Collection

### 1. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**:
   - **Latency and Response Times**: Metrics around API response times and database query latencies help detect slowdowns.
   - **Throughput**: Track requests per second (RPS) or transactions per second to understand traffic and system load.
   - **Error Rates**: Collect metrics on exceptions, failed requests, and error responses (e.g., 5xx HTTP status codes) to detect anomalies.

### 2. **Resource Utilization**:
   - **CPU and Memory Usage**: Keep track of resource usage on each microservice instance, which helps identify bottlenecks or the need for autoscaling.
   - **Network Utilization**: Measure bandwidth usage and packet loss, especially for communication between microservices.

### 3. **Custom Business Metrics**:
   - **Domain-Specific Metrics**: Track business-related events such as the number of orders placed, payments processed, or users signed up. This data can help align performance monitoring with business goals.

### 4. **Scalability**:
   - Microservices scale horizontally, meaning you need metrics across multiple instances. Ensure that your metrics system can aggregate and visualize data across all instances of a service.

### 5. **Distributed Tracing**:
   - In a microservice architecture, a request often spans multiple services. Distributed tracing, when combined with metrics, helps pinpoint performance bottlenecks across services.

## Metrics Collection in Spring Boot 3.3.3

Spring Boot provides robust support for metrics collection through **Micrometer**—a metrics library integrated into the Spring ecosystem. Micrometer supports popular monitoring systems like Prometheus, Datadog, Graphite, and more.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. **Add Dependencies**
In your `pom.xml`, include the following dependencies to enable metrics collection and monitoring.

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- Micrometer core -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
        <artifactId>micrometer-core</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Micrometer Prometheus registry for metrics exposure -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
        <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Spring Boot Actuator for exposing metrics -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### 2. **Enable Metrics Endpoint**
Spring Boot Actuator exposes a variety of built-in metrics. To enable these metrics endpoints, configure your `application.yml`:

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health, metrics, prometheus
  metrics:
    export:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
```

The **`/actuator/prometheus`** endpoint will now expose the application’s metrics in a Prometheus-readable format.

### 3. **Custom Metrics Collection**
In addition to default metrics, you can create custom business metrics. Here’s an example of tracking the number of orders:

```java
import io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class OrderService {

    private final MeterRegistry meterRegistry;

    public OrderService(MeterRegistry meterRegistry) {
        this.meterRegistry = meterRegistry;
    }

    public void placeOrder() {
        // Logic to place order

        // Increment custom counter
        meterRegistry.counter("orders.placed").increment();
    }
}
```

### 4. **Monitor JVM Metrics**
Spring Boot exposes JVM metrics, such as memory usage, garbage collection, and thread counts, out of the box. You can view these metrics by querying Prometheus or visualizing them in Grafana.

### 5. **Distributed Tracing with Micrometer**
To add distributed tracing, use **Spring Cloud Sleuth** in combination with Micrometer. Add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This will automatically generate trace and span IDs for your requests, allowing you to correlate logs and metrics across services.

## Metrics Visualization

Prometheus and Grafana are the most common tools for metrics collection and visualization in the Spring ecosystem.

### 1. **Prometheus Configuration**
Prometheus scrapes metrics from the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint. Add the following configuration to Prometheus to scrape your Spring Boot application:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spring-boot-app'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
```

### 2. **Grafana Dashboards**
Once Prometheus is scraping your metrics, use Grafana to create dashboards for visualization. Grafana offers several pre-built dashboards for JVM metrics, HTTP requests, and custom business metrics.
