# Integrating CI/CD with Jenkins

Jenkins is a leading automation server that is widely used to set up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines. It allows developers to automatically build, test, and deploy their applications, enabling faster and more reliable delivery of software. This section covers how to integrate Jenkins into your CI/CD workflows, especially for Spring Boot applications.

## 1. **Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins**

Continuous Integration involves automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. Jenkins can be configured to automatically build and test your application whenever changes are pushed to a version control system like Git.

### Steps to Set Up CI in Jenkins:
1. **Create a Jenkins Job**:
   - In Jenkins, go to the **Dashboard** and click on **New Item**.
   - Choose a **Freestyle Project** or **Pipeline** project based on your preference.

2. **Set Up Git Repository**:
   - Under **Source Code Management**, select **Git**.
   - Enter the URL of your repository (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repository.git`).
   - Specify the branch to be built, usually `main` or `develop`.

3. **Configure Build Triggers**:
   - Under **Build Triggers**, choose **Poll SCM** or **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling** to automatically trigger a build whenever changes are pushed.
   - For **Poll SCM**, configure the schedule using cron syntax (e.g., `H/5 * * * *` to check for changes every 5 minutes).

4. **Build Steps**:
   - Add a **Build Step** to compile and run tests for your Spring Boot project.
   - For Maven projects:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```

5. **Test Reports**:
   - Under **Post-build Actions**, configure **Publish JUnit test result report** to track test results:
     ```bash
     **/target/surefire-reports/*.xml
     ```

6. **View Build Results**:
   - After the build, Jenkins provides reports on build status, test outcomes, and any code coverage if configured.

## 2. **Continuous Delivery (CD) with Jenkins**

Continuous Delivery extends CI by automatically deploying the code to a staging or production environment after passing the necessary build and test stages. With Jenkins, you can define complex deployment pipelines using either Freestyle jobs or the more advanced **Jenkins Pipelines**.

### Steps to Set Up CD in Jenkins:
1. **Create a Jenkins Pipeline**:
   - Go to **Dashboard** > **New Item** > **Pipeline**.
   - Write a Jenkinsfile that defines your CI/CD pipeline.

2. **Pipeline Definition**:
   A simple Jenkinsfile for a Spring Boot project might look like this:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Checkout') {
               steps {
                   git 'https://github.com/username/repository.git'
               }
           }
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   sh 'mvn clean package'
               }
           }
           stage('Test') {
               steps {
                   sh 'mvn test'
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy to Staging') {
               steps {
                   sh './deploy-to-staging.sh'
               }
           }
       }
       post {
           always {
               junit '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
               archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', fingerprint: true
           }
           success {
               echo 'Build and Deployment successful!'
           }
           failure {
               echo 'Build or Deployment failed!'
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Deploying to Kubernetes**:
   For Spring Boot applications deployed to Kubernetes (e.g., Minikube), Jenkins can execute shell scripts or use Kubernetes plugins to manage deployments.

   Example deployment step in Jenkinsfile:
   ```groovy
   stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
       steps {
           sh '''
           kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
           kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
           '''
       }
   }
   ```

   Ensure that your Jenkins container or machine has access to `kubectl` and is authenticated to your Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, GKE, etc.).

4. **Rollback Strategy**:
   To make the pipeline more robust, implement a rollback mechanism if the deployment to production fails.
   Example of adding rollback to Jenkinsfile:
   ```groovy
   stage('Deploy to Production') {
       steps {
           script {
               try {
                   sh './deploy-to-production.sh'
               } catch (Exception err) {
                   echo "Deployment failed, rolling back..."
                   sh './rollback-production.sh'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

## 3. **Pipeline as Code (Jenkinsfile)**

A **Jenkinsfile** defines the entire CI/CD pipeline as code, making it easier to version, review, and reuse. For Spring Boot applications, Jenkins Pipelines provide flexibility to run complex build steps, including environment-specific deployments, integration testing, and even blue-green or canary deployments.

### Key Concepts in Jenkins Pipelines:
- **Stages**: Break the pipeline into logical steps such as build, test, and deploy.
- **Steps**: Each stage contains steps like shell commands, script executions, or invoking other Jenkins jobs.
- **Post-build Actions**: Configure steps that run after the pipeline execution (e.g., sending notifications, archiving artifacts, or deploying).

## 4. **CI/CD Best Practices with Jenkins**

1. **Test Early and Often**: Integrate unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks (e.g., SonarQube) into the pipeline to catch issues early.
   
2. **Build Once, Deploy Anywhere**: The same build artifact (e.g., a JAR file) should be deployed to multiple environments (staging, production) to avoid discrepancies between builds.

3. **Automate Rollbacks**: Automatically roll back deployments in case of failures during production deployment to minimize downtime.

4. **Monitor Builds and Deployments**: Use Jenkins plugins like **Prometheus Metrics** or **Slack Notifications** to get real-time insights into the status of builds and deployments.

5. **Parallelism and Stages**: Take advantage of parallel stages in Jenkins to run tests or builds concurrently, reducing pipeline execution time.

   Example of parallel testing stages in a Jenkinsfile:
   ```groovy
   stage('Test') {
       parallel {
           stage('Unit Tests') {
               steps {
                   sh 'mvn test'
               }
           }
           stage('Integration Tests') {
               steps {
                   sh 'mvn verify'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

# Complete steps for sample  

## **1. Prerequisites**

Before you start, ensure you have the following set up:

1. **Maven Multi-module Project (Mono Repo)**:
   - A multi-module Maven project where each Spring Boot application is in its own submodule.

2. **Jenkins Installed and Running**:
   - Jenkins is installed and running either on your local machine (Docker) or a server.

3. **Maven Installed in Jenkins**:
   - Maven is installed in Jenkins and properly configured under **Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration**.

4. **Git Repository**:
   - Your project is hosted on a Git repository (local or remote). Jenkins will need access to clone this repository.

---

## **2. Project Structure**

Assuming the following Maven multi-module project structure in your Git repository:

```
/mono-repo
  |-- pom.xml             # Parent Maven POM
  |-- app1
  |    |-- pom.xml        # Spring Boot Application 1
  |-- app2
  |    |-- pom.xml        # Spring Boot Application 2
  |-- app3
       |-- pom.xml        # Spring Boot Application 3
```

The root `pom.xml` defines the submodules (`app1`, `app2`, `app3`).

---

## **3. Create a New Jenkins Pipeline Job**

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Login to Jenkins**.
2. Click **New Item** from the Jenkins dashboard.
3. Name the project (e.g., `OurEcommerce-CICD`) and select **Pipeline**.
4. Click **OK** to create the pipeline job.

---

## **4. Define the `Jenkinsfile` Pipeline**

To build only the changed modules, you'll use a **Jenkinsfile** stored in your Git repository. The `Jenkinsfile` will:

1. Check out the code.
2. Detect which Maven submodules have changed.
3. Use Maven's reactor feature to build only those submodules and their dependencies.

### Sample `Jenkinsfile`

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    tools {
        maven 'Maven 3.8.1'  // Specify your Maven version
    }

    environment {
        // Placeholder to store the changed modules
        CHANGED_MODULES = ''
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the code from the repository
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/user/mono-repo.git'
                
                script {
                    // Detect changes between the current commit and the previous commit
                    CHANGED_MODULES = sh(script: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | grep '^[^/]*'", returnStdout: true).trim()
                    if (!CHANGED_MODULES) {
                        echo 'No changes detected in any modules.'
                        currentBuild.result = 'SUCCESS'
                        return
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Build Changed Modules') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // List the changed modules (subdirectories)
                    def modules = CHANGED_MODULES.tokenize('\n').join(',')
                    echo "Building the following modules: ${modules}"

                    // Run Maven, only building the changed modules and their dependencies
                    sh "mvn clean install -pl ${modules} -am"
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', fingerprint: true
            echo 'Build process completed!'
        }
    }
}
```

### **Explanation of the Jenkinsfile:**

- **Checkout Stage**: 
  - The `git` command checks out the repository. The `git diff` command detects changes between the latest commit (`HEAD`) and the previous one (`HEAD~1`), filtering only the top-level subdirectories (i.e., `app1`, `app2`, `app3`).
  - The `CHANGED_MODULES` variable stores the list of changed modules.
  
- **Build Changed Modules Stage**:
  - The script processes the list of changed modules and runs `mvn clean install -pl <modules> -am`. This ensures that only the changed modules are built, along with their dependencies.
  
- **Post Actions**:
  - Artifacts (JAR files) are archived for future reference or deployment, and a build completion message is printed.

---

## **5. Add the `Jenkinsfile` to Your Git Repository**

1. Navigate to the root of your mono repo project directory.
2. Create a file named `Jenkinsfile` in the root directory (if it doesn't already exist):

```bash
touch Jenkinsfile
```

3. Open the `Jenkinsfile` and paste the pipeline code from the previous step.
4. Commit and push the `Jenkinsfile` to your Git repository:

```bash
git add Jenkinsfile
git commit -m "Add Jenkinsfile to build only changed modules"
git push origin main
```

---

## **6. Configure Jenkins to Use the Pipeline from SCM**

1. In Jenkins, go to the pipeline job you created earlier.
2. Click **Configure**.
3. Scroll down to the **Pipeline** section.
4. Under **Definition**, select **Pipeline script from SCM**.
5. In the **SCM** field, select **Git**.
6. Enter your repository URL.
7. Specify the branch to build (e.g., `main`).
8. In the **Script Path** field, type `Jenkinsfile` (this points Jenkins to the file in your repository).
9. Click **Save**.

---

## **7. Trigger a Build**

You can now trigger a build manually or set up a webhook to trigger builds automatically when changes are pushed to your repository.

- **Manual Build**: 
   - Go to your Jenkins pipeline job and click **Build Now**.

- **Webhook for Automatic Build**:
   - Set up a webhook in your Git repository to notify Jenkins when code is pushed.
   - For GitHub, this can be done under **Settings > Webhooks** and providing the Jenkins webhook URL (`http://<JENKINS_URL>/github-webhook/`).

---

## **8. Verify and Monitor the Build**

Once the build is triggered, you can monitor the progress in Jenkins:

- **Console Output**: Jenkins will show which modules were detected as changed and whether they were successfully built.
- **Artifacts**: The generated `.jar` files for the changed modules will be archived in Jenkins.

---

## **9. Optimize Further (Optional)**

- **Customize Git Diff Range**: 
  - You can customize the Git diff range to compare with other branches or commits, such as `git diff --name-only origin/main HEAD` to detect changes compared to the `main` branch.
  
- **Pipeline Triggers**: 
  - Integrate Jenkins with Git hooks or polling to automatically trigger builds when relevant changes are detected in your Git repository.

---

### Summary

1. Set up Jenkins with the pipeline job.
2. Define and commit a `Jenkinsfile` that uses Git to detect changes and Maven’s reactor feature to build only changed modules.
3. Configure Jenkins to use the `Jenkinsfile` from SCM.
4. Trigger builds manually or via webhooks.
