# Creating a Jenkins Pipeline

Jenkins Pipelines are the backbone of CI/CD automation. They define the steps required to build, test, and deploy applications. Pipelines in Jenkins can be created either through the Jenkins UI or by using a `Jenkinsfile`, which allows you to store and version your pipeline configuration in a code repository alongside your project.

## 1. **Types of Jenkins Pipelines**

There are two types of Jenkins pipelines:

- **Declarative Pipeline**: A simpler, structured way to define a pipeline using a predefined syntax. It is easier to read and write, making it the preferred choice for most projects.
- **Scripted Pipeline**: A more flexible and powerful approach, allowing Groovy-based scripting for advanced workflows. It is used when custom logic is required, but is generally more complex.

For most Spring Boot projects, **Declarative Pipelines** are sufficient and are recommended because of their cleaner syntax and ease of use.

## 2. **Pipeline Syntax**

### **Declarative Pipeline Syntax**

The **Declarative Pipeline** syntax is structured and allows you to define stages, steps, and conditions in a clear and readable format.

Here is a basic structure of a Declarative Pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    tools {
        maven 'Maven 3.8.1'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/user/spring-boot-project.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }

        stage('Package') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Deployment steps (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker, etc.)
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            echo 'Pipeline finished!'
            junit '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', fingerprint: true
        }
    }
}
```

- **`pipeline`**: The root block that defines the pipeline. Inside, you declare the stages and steps.
- **`agent any`**: Specifies where the pipeline or stage will run. `any` means it can run on any available agent.
- **`tools`**: Allows you to specify tools (like Maven or JDK) that the pipeline will use.
- **`stages`**: Defines the different stages of the pipeline, such as Checkout, Build, Test, and Deploy.
- **`steps`**: The individual actions that Jenkins performs in each stage.
- **`post`**: Contains actions to be executed after the pipeline finishes, regardless of the build’s success or failure.

### **Scripted Pipeline Syntax**

The **Scripted Pipeline** is written in Groovy and provides more flexibility but requires more boilerplate code. Here's a simple example of a scripted pipeline:

```groovy
node {
    stage('Checkout') {
        checkout scm
    }

    stage('Build') {
        sh 'mvn clean install'
    }

    stage('Test') {
        sh 'mvn test'
    }

    stage('Package') {
        sh 'mvn package'
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
        // Custom deployment steps
    }

    post {
        always {
            junit '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
```

- **`node {}`**: The `node` block is used to define what steps to execute on which Jenkins agent (node). Inside, you define stages and steps.
- **`stage`**: Each stage groups related build steps, such as `Build`, `Test`, and `Package`.

## 3. **Versioning and Maintaining the Pipeline as Code**

Jenkins pipelines can (and should) be maintained as code by using a `Jenkinsfile`. A `Jenkinsfile` allows you to define the pipeline in a file stored in the same version control repository as the codebase. This approach brings several advantages:
- **Version Control**: By keeping the `Jenkinsfile` in the same Git repository as the code, you can track changes to the pipeline over time. Any changes to the CI/CD process can be reviewed and rolled back if necessary.
- **Reusability**: The `Jenkinsfile` can be reused across different branches or projects with minor adjustments, making it easier to maintain consistent pipelines.
- **Transparency**: Having the pipeline stored as code makes the CI/CD process visible to the entire development team, improving collaboration and reducing dependency on manual Jenkins configuration.

## **Creating and Storing a Jenkinsfile**

To create a `Jenkinsfile`:
1. In the root directory of your project (next to your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`), create a file named `Jenkinsfile`.
2. Define your pipeline inside this file using either the declarative or scripted syntax.

For example, here’s how the `Jenkinsfile` for a Spring Boot project using Maven might look:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    tools {
        maven 'Maven 3.8.1'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/user/spring-boot-project.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }

        stage('Package') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Assuming Kubernetes deployment
                kubernetesDeploy(
                    configs: 'k8s/deployment.yaml',
                    kubeconfigId: 'kube-config'
                )
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline completed successfully'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed'
        }
        always {
            junit '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', fingerprint: true
        }
    }
}
```

## 4. **Using Multibranch Pipelines**

If you have multiple branches in your Git repository (such as `main`, `dev`, and feature branches), Jenkins can use a **Multibranch Pipeline** to automatically detect new branches and create pipelines for each one.

To create a multibranch pipeline:
1. In the Jenkins dashboard, click on **New Item**.
2. Choose **Multibranch Pipeline**, and give it a name.
3. Configure the project to point to your Git repository.
4. Jenkins will scan the repository for branches that contain a `Jenkinsfile` and will create a pipeline for each branch.

Multibranch pipelines are useful for handling different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), allowing separate pipelines to be run for each branch.

## 5. **Maintaining Pipelines as Code: Best Practices**

- **Modularize Your Pipeline**: Use shared libraries or pipeline templates for common tasks. Jenkins allows you to define reusable pipeline steps that can be shared across multiple projects, reducing duplication.
  
- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Use environment variables or conditionals in your `Jenkinsfile` to handle different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod). You can pass variables to control different behavior, such as deploying to different Kubernetes namespaces.

- **Testing Pipeline Changes**: For significant changes to your pipeline, consider creating a feature branch and testing the modified pipeline on that branch before merging it into the main branch.

- **Use Descriptive Stages**: Name your stages clearly, making it easy to understand the flow of the pipeline at a glance. This is helpful when troubleshooting pipeline failures.

- **Keep Pipelines DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reuse code and logic wherever possible. Instead of repeating the same steps for multiple branches or environments, consider using conditionals or shared functions.

## Summary

Creating a pipeline in Jenkins is an essential part of automating the CI/CD process. Using a `Jenkinsfile` to define and store pipelines as code ensures version control, transparency, and easier maintenance across different environments and branches. By following best practices, you can build scalable, flexible pipelines that integrate seamlessly with your Spring Boot projects.
