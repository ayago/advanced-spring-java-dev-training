# Setup Jenkins using Docker

Running Jenkins in a Docker container is a convenient way to quickly set up a CI/CD environment. Docker simplifies the process of managing Jenkins, providing isolation and ensuring easy maintenance. Below are the steps to get Jenkins up and running using Docker.

## 1. **Prerequisites**
Before setting up Jenkins with Docker, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- **Docker**: You should have Docker installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose** (optional): If you want to manage multiple services (e.g., Jenkins, databases, or other containers), you can use Docker Compose.

## 2. **Pull the Jenkins Docker Image**
The official Jenkins image is available on Docker Hub. Start by pulling the image:

```bash
docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

This command pulls the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Jenkins. The LTS version is recommended for production use.

## 3. **Run Jenkins in a Docker Container**
Next, you can start Jenkins by running the following Docker command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name jenkins -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

Hereâ€™s what each flag does:
- `-d`: Runs Jenkins in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 8080:8080`: Maps the Jenkins UI port (8080) from the container to the host machine.
- `-p 50000:50000`: Maps the port for communication between the Jenkins master and its build agents.
- `--name jenkins`: Assigns the name `jenkins` to the container for easier management.
- `-v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home`: Maps the Jenkins data directory to a Docker volume (`jenkins_home`) to persist data, such as configuration and job history.

## 4. **Access Jenkins**
Once the container is running, you can access the Jenkins UI by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## 5. **Initial Setup**
On the first run, Jenkins will prompt you to unlock it using an administrator password. You can retrieve this password from the Docker logs:

```bash
docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Copy the password and paste it into the Jenkins setup page. From here, you can proceed with installing the recommended plugins or selecting specific plugins based on your project needs.

## 6. **Install Plugins for Maven, Git, and Kubernetes**
For a Spring Boot project using Maven and Kubernetes, you will need to install the appropriate Jenkins plugins. You can install plugins either through the Jenkins UI or via the `Jenkinsfile`.

- **Maven Integration Plugin**: Enables Jenkins to build Maven projects.
- **Git Plugin**: Allows Jenkins to interact with Git repositories.
- **Kubernetes Plugin**: Integrates Jenkins with Kubernetes for containerized deployments.

To install plugins from the Jenkins UI:
1. Go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins**.
2. Under the **Available** tab, search for the desired plugins and click **Install**.

## 7. **Configure Maven in Jenkins**
Once the Maven Integration Plugin is installed, you need to configure Maven in Jenkins. Follow these steps:
1. Go to **Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration**.
2. Under the **Maven** section, click **Add Maven**.
3. Name the Maven installation (e.g., `Maven 3.8.1`) and provide the installation path or let Jenkins install it automatically.

Now, Jenkins will be ready to build your Spring Boot applications using Maven.

## 8. **Creating a Jenkins Pipeline**
With Jenkins up and running, you can now create your pipeline using a `Jenkinsfile`. For a simple Spring Boot project, the `Jenkinsfile` might look like this:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    tools {
        maven 'Maven 3.8.1'  // Referencing the Maven installation from the configuration
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/user/spring-boot-project.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Package') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            junit '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
```

This basic pipeline covers code checkout, building, testing, and packaging your Spring Boot application.

## 9. **Running Jenkins with Docker Compose (Optional)**
If you want to manage multiple services (e.g., Jenkins and a database) together, Docker Compose simplifies the setup. Below is a sample `docker-compose.yml` file to run Jenkins and a PostgreSQL database:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  jenkins:
    image: jenkins/jenkins:lts
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "50000:50000"
    volumes:
      - jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home
    networks:
      - jenkins-network

  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    networks:
      - jenkins-network

networks:
  jenkins-network:

volumes:
  jenkins_home:
```

To bring up Jenkins and PostgreSQL together, run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This setup is ideal for advanced projects where Jenkins interacts with databases during the build or test process.

## 10. **Persisting Jenkins Data**
It is important to persist Jenkins data, including job configurations and build history. This is achieved by using Docker volumes (as seen in the `docker run` and `docker-compose` examples above). Using volumes ensures that the data is not lost even if the container is stopped or removed.

## Summary

Running Jenkins inside Docker offers a simple, reproducible, and isolated environment for CI/CD. With minimal setup, you can configure Jenkins to build, test, and deploy your Spring Boot applications using Maven, Kubernetes, and other tools. Docker also simplifies managing dependencies and plugins, ensuring Jenkins is easily portable across environments.
