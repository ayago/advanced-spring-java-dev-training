# Handling Notifications in Jenkins

Proper notification handling in Jenkins ensures that developers and stakeholders are promptly informed of build statuses. Jenkins supports various types of notifications, including email, Slack, and other messaging platforms. Effective notification management can help reduce downtime, speed up the resolution of build issues, and maintain transparency within the team.

## 1. **Email Notifications**

Jenkins provides built-in support for sending email notifications on build status changes, such as success, failure, or unstable builds.

### Steps to Configure Email Notifications:
1. **Install the Email Extension Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
   - Search for and install the **Email Extension Plugin**.

2. **Configure SMTP Settings**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.
   - Scroll down to the **Extended E-mail Notification** section.
   - Enter your SMTP server details, e.g., `smtp.gmail.com` for Gmail, along with the appropriate port, username, and password.

3. **Set Up Notifications in the Job**:
   - Open the configuration for the Jenkins job you want to set up notifications for.
   - Scroll to the **Post-build Actions** section.
   - Choose **Editable E-mail Notification**.
   - Configure the recipients (e.g., a list of developer emails).
   - Customize the notification settings (e.g., triggers for failure, unstable builds, or successful builds).
   
4. **Email Content Customization**:
   - You can also customize the subject and body of the email using environment variables like:
     ```bash
     $PROJECT_NAME: The name of the Jenkins job.
     $BUILD_STATUS: The result of the build (SUCCESS, FAILURE).
     $BUILD_URL: A link to the build page.
     ```

   Example:
   ```text
   Subject: Build $BUILD_STATUS - $PROJECT_NAME #$BUILD_NUMBER
   Body: Jenkins build $BUILD_NUMBER for project $PROJECT_NAME completed with status: $BUILD_STATUS. Check details at $BUILD_URL
   ```

## 2. **Slack Notifications**

Slack is a popular tool for team communication, and Jenkins can send notifications directly to Slack channels when a buildâ€™s status changes.

### Steps to Configure Slack Notifications:
1. **Install the Slack Notification Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
   - Search for and install the **Slack Notification Plugin**.

2. **Set Up a Slack App**:
   - Go to your Slack workspace, and create a new Slack App at [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps).
   - Enable **Incoming Webhooks** in your Slack app and create a webhook URL for the channel where you want notifications sent.

3. **Configure Slack Plugin in Jenkins**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.
   - Scroll to **Global Slack Notifier Settings**.
   - Enter your Slack workspace, channel name, and the webhook URL created in step 2.
   - Test the integration to ensure that Slack notifications are working correctly.

4. **Configure Job Notifications**:
   - In your Jenkins job configuration, scroll to **Post-build Actions**.
   - Select **Slack Notifications**.
   - Choose when to send notifications (e.g., on build failure, success, or always).
   - You can also customize the message sent to Slack.

   Example:
   ```bash
   Build $BUILD_NUMBER for $PROJECT_NAME is $BUILD_STATUS.
   Check the build details here: $BUILD_URL
   ```

## 3. **Custom Notifications Using Groovy Scripts**

For more flexibility, Jenkins allows the use of Groovy scripts to handle notifications based on specific conditions.

### Steps to Create Custom Notifications:
1. **Install the Groovy Plugin** (if not already installed):
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins** and install the **Groovy Plugin**.

2. **Add a Post-Build Groovy Script**:
   - In your Jenkins job configuration, scroll to **Post-build Actions** and select **Execute Groovy Script**.
   - Write a custom script to handle notifications based on the build status and other conditions.

   Example:
   ```groovy
   if (currentBuild.result == 'FAILURE') {
       // Send a custom email or Slack notification
       // You can use Groovy's built-in email or curl functions to send messages
       println "Build failed. Sending custom notification..."
   }
   ```

3. **Advanced Groovy Scripting**:
   - Use Groovy scripts for advanced notification handling, such as:
     - Sending notifications based on specific build stages or steps.
     - Sending notifications to different recipients based on the type of failure (e.g., test failure, deployment failure).
     - Integrating with other communication platforms using REST API calls.

## 4. **Webhook Notifications**

Webhooks are useful for integrating Jenkins with external services and triggering notifications through custom systems, such as messaging platforms, issue tracking tools, or monitoring systems.

### Steps to Set Up Webhook Notifications:
1. **Configure a Post-build Webhook**:
   - In the job configuration, under **Post-build Actions**, choose **Trigger Remote Build**.
   - Enter the URL of the webhook endpoint that should be triggered after the build (e.g., a service that processes notifications or logs build results).

2. **Custom Payload**:
   - You can customize the payload sent to the webhook by passing relevant environment variables, such as `$BUILD_STATUS`, `$BUILD_URL`, and more.

3. **Examples**:
   - Integrate with issue tracking systems (e.g., Jira) by sending a webhook when a build fails, automatically creating a ticket for the failure.
   - Send data to monitoring systems like Prometheus via a webhook when specific metrics are met during the build.

## 5. **JIRA Integration for Issue Tracking**

You can integrate Jenkins with Jira to automatically create or update issues when builds fail.

### Steps to Configure Jira Notifications:
1. **Install the Jira Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
   - Search for and install the **Jira Plugin**.

2. **Configure Jira Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.
   - In the **Jira Integration** section, provide the Jira server URL, project, and credentials.

3. **Post-build Jira Actions**:
   - In your Jenkins job configuration, under **Post-build Actions**, select **JIRA: Create Issue** or **JIRA: Add Comment** to update the issue status when a build fails.

## 6. **Real-Time Notifications via Jenkins UI (Blue Ocean)**

**Blue Ocean** provides a real-time, visual approach to pipeline and build monitoring with built-in notifications.

### Steps to Use Blue Ocean for Notifications:
1. **Install the Blue Ocean Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins** and install **Blue Ocean**.
2. **Monitor Builds via Blue Ocean**:
   - Access the Blue Ocean interface from your Jenkins dashboard.
   - The UI provides a pipeline visualization with real-time updates, including build stages and notifications of failures or successes.
