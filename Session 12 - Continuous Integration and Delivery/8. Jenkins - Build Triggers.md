# Jenkins Build Triggers

In Jenkins, build triggers are mechanisms that automate the process of starting a build. Configuring proper triggers is crucial for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines, especially in complex multi-module projects like those using Spring Boot and Maven. Below, we will cover the most common and powerful trigger methods Jenkins offers.

## 1. **Poll SCM**
Polling the Source Code Management (SCM) is a simple yet widely-used trigger. Jenkins checks the version control system (like Git) at defined intervals for changes, and if any are detected, a new build is triggered.

### Configuration Example:
In the Jenkins job configuration:
- **Build Triggers** > **Poll SCM** > Enter a cron-like schedule (e.g., `H/5 * * * *` to poll every 5 minutes).

This is suitable for scenarios where you expect frequent changes or are not using a webhook mechanism.

### Pros:
- Simple to configure.
- No external system dependencies.

### Cons:
- Inefficient for larger repositories due to frequent polling.
- Delayed responses between a commit and build.

## 2. **GitHub/Bitbucket Webhooks**
Using webhooks, Jenkins is notified directly by the version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) whenever a new commit is pushed, bypassing the need for periodic polling.

### Configuration Example:
1. In Jenkins:
   - **Build Triggers** > **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling** (for GitHub) or **Build when a change is pushed to Bitbucket** (for Bitbucket).
2. In the repository settings (GitHub/Bitbucket), configure a webhook to the Jenkins server’s `/github-webhook/` or `/bitbucket-hook/` endpoint.

This ensures that Jenkins immediately starts a build upon code pushes, allowing faster feedback loops.

### Pros:
- Real-time builds with no delay.
- No overhead of SCM polling.

### Cons:
- Requires network access from the repository to Jenkins.
- Webhook misconfiguration can lead to missed triggers.

## 3. **Build After Other Projects Are Built**
For multi-module Spring Boot applications in a mono repo, it’s common to trigger builds of dependent modules based on the successful build of another module.

### Configuration Example:
In the Jenkins job configuration:
- **Build Triggers** > **Build after other projects are built** and specify the upstream project(s).

This setup ensures that changes in a core module will trigger the necessary downstream builds, maintaining consistency across modules.

### Pros:
- Ensures dependency order is maintained in multi-module setups.
- Efficient for managing builds in complex architectures.

### Cons:
- Dependencies between jobs must be well-defined.
- Might lead to longer pipeline chains if overused.

## 4. **Periodic Builds**
For long-running tests or processes, you may need a trigger that runs at scheduled intervals, regardless of SCM changes. This is useful for nightly builds or batch processes.

### Configuration Example:
In the Jenkins job configuration:
- **Build Triggers** > **Build periodically** > Enter a cron-like schedule (e.g., `H 2 * * *` for daily builds at 2 AM).

### Pros:
- Useful for running non-code tasks, such as security scans or performance testing.
- Simple scheduling mechanism.

### Cons:
- Might build even when unnecessary (e.g., no changes since the last build).

## 5. **Parameterized Builds**
You can trigger builds manually or via other automation scripts with specific parameters. This allows you to pass variables such as branch names, environment settings, or version numbers to customize the build behavior.

### Configuration Example:
- **Build Triggers** > **This build is parameterized** and define the needed parameters (e.g., choice, string, etc.).
- Use `curl` or other HTTP tools to trigger the build via Jenkins API with the appropriate parameters.

### Pros:
- Highly flexible.
- Can integrate with external systems for custom triggers.

### Cons:
- Requires setup of parameters and API calls.
- Can become complex if many parameters are needed.

## Setting Up Jenkins Build Triggers with GitHub

If you're using GitHub as your repository, Jenkins provides several ways to trigger builds based on events in your GitHub project. Below are detailed steps for configuring different trigger types for your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

### 1. **Poll SCM (Source Code Management)**

Polling SCM regularly checks your GitHub repository for changes and triggers a build if it detects any new commits.

#### Steps:
1. Open your Jenkins job configuration.
2. Scroll to the **Build Triggers** section.
3. Check **Poll SCM**.
4. In the schedule field, enter a cron-like expression. For example:
   - `H/5 * * * *` will poll the repository every 5 minutes.
   
   The "H" helps distribute the load by randomly selecting a time within the specified range for each job.
   
5. Save your configuration.

### 2. **GitHub Webhook**

GitHub webhooks allow Jenkins to trigger builds immediately after a commit or pull request, without needing to poll the repository.

#### Steps:
1. **Configure Jenkins:**
   - Open the Jenkins job configuration.
   - Scroll to the **Build Triggers** section.
   - Check **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**.
   
2. **Configure GitHub Webhook:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Webhooks**.
   - Click **Add webhook**.
   - Set the **Payload URL** to `http://<JENKINS_URL>/github-webhook/` (replace `<JENKINS_URL>` with your Jenkins server URL).
   - Select **application/json** as the content type.
   - In **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**, choose **Just the push event** or **Let me select individual events** depending on your needs (e.g., push events, pull request events).
   - Click **Add webhook**.

### 3. **Build After Other Projects Are Built**

This trigger ensures that Jenkins jobs are executed sequentially, triggering a downstream build when the upstream job completes.

#### Steps:
1. Open the Jenkins job configuration for your downstream project.
2. Scroll to the **Build Triggers** section.
3. Check **Build after other projects are built**.
4. In the input field, specify the names of the upstream projects (those that need to finish first).
5. Save your configuration.

### 4. **Periodic Builds**

For scenarios where you want Jenkins to build at specific times (e.g., nightly builds), you can set up a periodic build trigger.

#### Steps:
1. Open the Jenkins job configuration.
2. Scroll to the **Build Triggers** section.
3. Check **Build periodically**.
4. In the schedule field, enter a cron-like expression:
   - `H 2 * * *` for daily builds at 2 AM.
   - `H 4 * * 1-5` for builds at 4 AM, Monday through Friday.
5. Save your configuration.

### 5. **Parameterized Builds**

Parameterized builds allow you to trigger Jenkins jobs manually or from external scripts with specific parameters, such as GitHub branch names, version numbers, or environment details.

#### Steps:
1. Open the Jenkins job configuration.
2. Scroll to the **General** section.
3. Check **This project is parameterized**.
4. Click **Add Parameter** and choose the parameter type (e.g., **String Parameter**, **Choice Parameter**).
   - Example: For a branch parameter, choose **String Parameter** and name it `BRANCH`. Default it to `main`.
5. Save your configuration.

#### Triggering via API:
1. To trigger a build via the Jenkins API, use the following `curl` command:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://<JENKINS_URL>/job/<JOB_NAME>/buildWithParameters?BRANCH=feature-branch"

## Special Mention: Trigger build from your local git repo

To trigger Jenkins builds locally when changes are detected in your **main** branch from a local `.git` repository, you need to simulate a webhook-like mechanism since webhooks are typically designed for remote services like GitHub or Bitbucket.

For your local setup, you can use a **post-commit hook** in Git along with the Jenkins **remote trigger** feature. Here’s how to set this up:

### Steps:

#### 1. **Enable Jenkins Remote Build Trigger**

1. Open your Jenkins job configuration.
2. Scroll down to the **Build Triggers** section.
3. Check **Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)**.
4. Set a secure **Authentication Token** (e.g., `my-secret-token`).

   Example:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080/job/<JOB_NAME>/build?token=my-secret-token
   ```

   Replace `<JOB_NAME>` with your Jenkins job name.

5. Save your configuration.

#### 2. **Configure a Git Hook for Local Changes**

In your local Git repository, you can configure a `post-commit` or `post-push` hook to send an HTTP request to Jenkins after every commit or push to the **main** branch.

1. Navigate to your Git repository’s `.git/hooks/` directory.
2. Create a new file called `post-commit` (or `post-push`, depending on your preference).

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/repo/.git/hooks
   touch post-commit
   chmod +x post-commit
   ```

3. Edit the `post-commit` file and add the following script to trigger Jenkins:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
   
   # Trigger Jenkins build only if the current branch is 'main'
   if [ "$BRANCH" == "main" ]; then
     curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/job/<JOB_NAME>/build?token=my-secret-token"
   fi
   ```

   Replace `<JOB_NAME>` with the name of your Jenkins job and `my-secret-token` with the token you configured earlier.

4. Save the file and close it.

#### 3. **Test the Setup**

1. Make a change in your local repository on the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Testing Jenkins trigger from local"
   ```

2. Once you commit, the `post-commit` hook will run, and it should trigger the Jenkins job automatically.

3. Open Jenkins and verify that the build is triggered.

#### 4. **Optional: Use `post-push` Hook Instead**
If you prefer triggering the build only after the changes are pushed to your local Git server or repository, you can use the `post-push` hook instead of `post-commit`.

Create a `post-push` file (if it doesn’t exist) and follow the same steps as in the `post-commit` example, adding the same logic to trigger Jenkins.
