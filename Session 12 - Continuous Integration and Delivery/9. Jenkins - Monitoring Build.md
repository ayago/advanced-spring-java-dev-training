# Monitoring Jenkins Builds

Monitoring builds is a critical aspect of ensuring the health of your CI/CD pipeline. Jenkins provides several built-in and plugin-based options to monitor the status, performance, and stability of your builds. This section covers various ways to monitor Jenkins builds, including real-time tracking, notifications, and build history insights.

## 1. **Real-Time Build Monitoring**

Jenkins provides a live view of your builds directly from the dashboard, allowing you to track the progress of builds in real time.

### Steps:
1. **Jenkins Build Dashboard:**
   - From the Jenkins dashboard, navigate to your job.
   - Youâ€™ll see a list of recent builds with details such as build number, status (success, failure, or in progress), and duration.
   - Click on a specific build number to get detailed information about that build, including the console output.

2. **Blue Ocean UI (Optional):**
   - For a more visual interface, you can install the **Blue Ocean** plugin.
   - It offers an intuitive pipeline view that shows real-time progress and the current stage of each build.

   **To install Blue Ocean**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
   - Search for **Blue Ocean** and install it.
   - Once installed, access the Blue Ocean UI from the Jenkins dashboard.

## 2. **Build Console Output**

To monitor the exact steps being executed in a build, use the console output feature.

### Steps:
1. During a build, click on the specific build number from the job's build history.
2. Click on **Console Output** to view the logs of the current or completed build.
   - The console output displays each command executed, its output, and any errors or warnings.
   - If a build fails, Jenkins often highlights the point of failure in the logs for easier troubleshooting.

## 3. **Email and Slack Notifications**

Automated notifications are key to ensuring that relevant team members are informed about build statuses without manually checking Jenkins. You can set up Jenkins to send notifications via email or Slack.

### Email Notifications:
1. Ensure the **Email Extension Plugin** is installed.
2. Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.
3. Scroll to **Extended E-mail Notification** and configure your SMTP server settings.
4. In your Jenkins job configuration:
   - Scroll to **Post-build Actions**.
   - Choose **Editable E-mail Notification** and configure the recipient list.
   - Customize the email content based on the build status (success, failure, unstable).

### Slack Notifications:
1. Install the **Slack Notification Plugin**.
2. Configure the plugin with your Slack webhook URL:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.
   - Scroll to **Global Slack Notifier Settings** and input your team domain and integration token (from Slack).
3. In your job configuration:
   - Under **Post-build Actions**, select **Slack Notifications**.
   - Configure when to send the notification (e.g., on failure, success, or always).

## 4. **Build History and Trends**

Tracking historical builds helps identify patterns such as build failures, unstable builds, and flaky tests. Jenkins provides a build history view that tracks build results over time.

### Steps:
1. **Job Build History:**
   - In the Jenkins job page, the **Build History** section shows a chronological list of past builds.
   - Each entry is color-coded: green for success, red for failure, and yellow for unstable builds.
   - Clicking on a specific build number provides access to logs, changes, test results, and artifacts.

2. **Build Trends:**
   - Install the **Build History Plugin** to generate trends and charts over time.
   - You can view metrics like build duration, success rate, and average time per stage.

## 5. **Pipeline Stage View Plugin**

If you are using Jenkins pipelines, the **Pipeline Stage View Plugin** offers a visual representation of each stage in your pipeline, allowing for easier monitoring of multi-step builds.

### Steps:
1. Install the **Pipeline Stage View Plugin** from **Manage Plugins**.
2. Navigate to your pipeline job and view the **Pipeline Steps** section.
   - This view breaks down each stage of the build and indicates whether the stage passed, failed, or is still in progress.

## 6. **Using Jenkins Metrics for Monitoring**

For more advanced monitoring, Jenkins can be integrated with monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.

### Prometheus Plugin for Jenkins:
1. Install the **Prometheus Metrics Plugin** from **Manage Plugins**.
2. Configure the plugin in **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.
   - Enable the **Expose Prometheus Metrics** option to allow Prometheus to collect metrics from your Jenkins instance.
   
   Metrics like build times, failure rates, and job counts can then be visualized in Grafana for better tracking.

## 7. **Build Health Monitoring with Build Monitor Plugin**

The **Build Monitor Plugin** provides a visual dashboard summarizing the health of all your jobs.

### Steps:
1. Install the **Build Monitor Plugin**.
2. Go to **Dashboard** > **New View**.
3. Choose **Build Monitor View**.
4. Select the jobs you want to monitor, and Jenkins will display the health of these jobs in a single, compact view.
