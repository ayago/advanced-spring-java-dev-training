# Connection Between Spring Cloud Gateway and Spring Cloud Load Balancer

Spring Cloud Gateway integrates seamlessly with Spring Cloud Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of microservices. This connection allows the API Gateway to route requests intelligently, ensuring reliability, performance, and high availability of services. By using load balancing, Spring Cloud Gateway can manage traffic spikes and avoid overloading individual instances.

## Configuration examples

#### 1. Example: Basic Load Balancing Configuration

To set up Spring Cloud Load Balancer with Spring Cloud Gateway, add the following dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

You can then configure the `application.yml` file to define the route and enable load balancing:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: product-service
          uri: lb://PRODUCT-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/products/**
```

#### Explanation:

In this example:
- **`uri: lb://PRODUCT-SERVICE`**: The `lb://` prefix tells Spring Cloud Gateway to use the Load Balancer to resolve the address of the `PRODUCT-SERVICE` instances.
- **`Path=/products/**`**: The predicate matches all incoming requests with the path `/products/**`, routing them to the `PRODUCT-SERVICE`.
- Spring Cloud Load Balancer distributes the requests among multiple instances of the `PRODUCT-SERVICE`.

### 2. Configuring Load Balancing Without Service Discovery

To configure load balancing without a service discovery tool, use the `spring.cloud.discovery.simple.instances` property. This allows you to define service instances directly in the configuration file.

#### Example: Load Balancing Without Service Discovery

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: product-service
          uri: lb://product-service
          predicates:
            - Path=/products/**
    discovery:
      simple:
        instances:
          product-service:
            - serviceId: product-service
              instanceId: product-service-1
              host: localhost
              port: 8081
              secure: false
            - serviceId: product-service
              instanceId: product-service-2
              host: localhost
              port: 8082
              secure: false
```

#### Explanation:

- **`spring.cloud.discovery.simple.instances`**: This configuration sets up a simple discovery mechanism that allows you to manually define instances of `product-service`.
- **`product-service`**: The name of the service as it would be registered or referenced. The instances (`http://localhost:8081` and `http://localhost:8082`) are defined under this service name.
- The `lb://product-service` URI in the gateway route tells Spring Cloud Gateway to load balance the requests between these manually defined instances.
- **`serviceId`**: Identifies the logical name of the service (`product-service`). This is the name used in the `lb://product-service` URI, allowing the gateway to look up the instances to route requests.
- **`instanceId`**: Provides a unique identifier for each instance (e.g., `product-service-1`, `product-service-2`). This is useful for tracking and managing instances individually.
- **`host`**: Specifies the hostname or IP address where the instance is running (`localhost` in this case).
- **`port`**: The port on which the service instance is listening (e.g., `8081`, `8082`).
- **`secure`**: Indicates whether the service instance uses HTTPS (`true` for HTTPS, `false` for HTTP). This is set to `false` since the instances are using HTTP.

By using `spring.cloud.discovery.simple.instances`, you provide a declarative way to manage service instances for load balancing, which simplifies the configuration and reduces the overhead of setting up a separate service discovery tool when it is not needed.

### 3. Configuring Load Balancing With Service Discovery

When using a service discovery tool, such as Eureka, Spring Cloud Gateway can dynamically discover service instances and balance the load among them. 

#### Example: Load Balancing With Eureka Service Discovery

Ensure that the Spring Cloud Gateway application is registered with Eureka by adding the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Then, configure the `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: gateway-service
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: product-service
          uri: lb://PRODUCT-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/products/**
eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
```

#### Explanation:

- **Eureka Client**: The `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client` dependency enables Eureka Client functionality.
- **`eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone`**: Configures the location of the Eureka server.
- The `PRODUCT-SERVICE` URI tells the Spring Cloud Gateway to query Eureka for instances of the `PRODUCT-SERVICE` and to load balance requests among them dynamically.

## How Spring Cloud Gateway Works Seamlessly with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer

Spring Cloud Gateway and Spring Cloud LoadBalancer work together to provide a robust and flexible solution for routing and load balancing requests in a microservices architecture. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how they seamlessly integrate:

### **Integration Mechanism**

#### **Routing Requests**

- **Service Discovery**: When you define routes in Spring Cloud Gateway, you can use the `lb://` prefix in the URI to denote that the gateway should use the Spring Cloud LoadBalancer to resolve the service instances.
  
  ```yaml
  spring:
    cloud:
      gateway:
        routes:
          - id: product-service
            uri: lb://product-service
            predicates:
              - Path=/products/**
  ```

- **Service Resolution**: When a request is routed to `lb://product-service`, Spring Cloud Gateway delegates the task of resolving the service instances to Spring Cloud LoadBalancer. LoadBalancer queries the configured service discovery (if any) or uses the instances defined in the configuration.

#### **Load Balancing Requests**

- **Client-Side Load Balancing**: Spring Cloud LoadBalancer handles the distribution of requests to various instances of a service. It uses strategies like Round Robin, Weighted Response Time, etc., to decide how to route the requests among available instances.

- **Instance Resolution**: Spring Cloud LoadBalancer may use service discovery mechanisms (like Eureka or Consul) or manually defined instances to determine which service instances are available.

### **Configuration Examples**

#### **Basic Configuration**

**`application.yml` for Gateway with Load Balancer:**

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: product-service
          uri: lb://product-service
          predicates:
            - Path=/products/**
```

**`application.yml` for LoadBalancer with Static Instances:**

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    discovery:
      simple:
        instances:
          product-service:
            - serviceId: product-service
              instanceId: product-service-1
              host: localhost
              port: 8081
              secure: false
            - serviceId: product-service
              instanceId: product-service-2
              host: localhost
              port: 8082
              secure: false
```

#### **Custom Load Balancer Configuration**

If you need a custom load balancing strategy, you can define it programmatically:

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.loadbalancer.annotation.LoadBalancerClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.loadbalancer.core.LoadBalancerClientFactory;
import org.springframework.cloud.loadbalancer.core.RoundRobinLoadBalancer;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class CustomLoadBalancerConfig {

    @Bean
    public RoundRobinLoadBalancer roundRobinLoadBalancer(LoadBalancerClientFactory clientFactory) {
        return new RoundRobinLoadBalancer(clientFactory.getInstance("product-service"));
    }
}
```

### **Key Points of Integration**

- **Delegated Load Balancing**: Spring Cloud Gateway relies on Spring Cloud LoadBalancer for managing how requests are distributed to service instances, abstracting away the complexity of balancing logic.
- **Service Resolution**: When routing a request, the Gateway uses LoadBalancer to resolve the actual service instances, whether from a service registry or static configuration.
- **Customization**: You can customize load balancing strategies and instance definitions to fit specific needs, providing flexibility in how requests are managed and distributed.
