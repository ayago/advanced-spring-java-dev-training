# Active Health Checks

Spring Cloud Gateway does not handle health checks directly; instead, it relies on the underlying service discovery and load balancing infrastructure. For instance, when using Eureka, the health status of each instance is monitored by Eureka itself. Only instances that are marked as 'UP' in Eureka will be considered for routing by the gateway. Specifically, the client side load balancer of the gateway already gets the healthy instances after querying the external ServiceDiscovery.

To implement active health checks, ensure the following:

1. **Service Configuration**: Ensure that each microservice has a health endpoint (e.g., `/actuator/health`) exposed and properly configured. This endpoint should be used by Eureka or other discovery services to determine the health status of the service.

2. **Discovery Service Configuration**: Configure the discovery service (e.g., Eureka) to perform periodic health checks on the registered instances.

3. **Load Balancer Integration**: Ensure that the load balancer is properly integrated with the discovery service so that it respects the health status reported by the discovery service.

By following these practices, you can ensure that your Spring Cloud Gateway setup will only route requests to instances of your services that are currently healthy, improving the overall reliability and performance of your microservices architecture.

## Instance active health check when there is no actual Service Registry or time sensitive check is needed

The `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.configurations: health-check` property in Spring Cloud LoadBalancer is used to enable and configure health checks for instances of services that are being load-balanced. The purpose of health checks is to ensure that the load balancer routes traffic only to healthy service instances, thereby improving the reliability and availability of your application.

### How `health-check` Works

When `health-check` is enabled, the Spring Cloud LoadBalancer periodically checks the health status of service instances using a health check endpoint (usually `/actuator/health`). If a service instance is marked as unhealthy, the load balancer will exclude it from its pool of available instances, ensuring that traffic is only directed to healthy instances.

### Enabling Health Checks with `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.configurations: health-check`

To enable health checks in your Spring Cloud LoadBalancer setup, you must provide a configuration class that sets up the health check mechanism.

#### YAML Configuration Example

Here's how you can enable health checks using a YAML configuration:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    loadbalancer:
      configurations: health-check
      health-check:
        interval: 30000    # Time interval between health checks in milliseconds
        path: /actuator/health  # Health check endpoint path
        initial-delay: 10000    # Delay before starting the first health check in milliseconds
        refetch-instances: false # Whether to refetch instances from the service registry for each health check
        success-threshold: 3    # Number of consecutive successful checks needed to mark an instance as healthy
        failure-threshold: 3    # Number of consecutive failed checks needed to mark an instance as unhealthy
        update-results-list: false # The entire alive instances sequence is first collected into a list and only then emitted, which ensures the flux, (healthCheckFlux), does not emit values in between the health-check intervals set in properties.
```

### Explanation of Key Properties

- **`interval`**: Specifies how often (in milliseconds) the load balancer should perform health checks on each instance. In the example above, health checks will occur every 30 seconds (`30000` milliseconds).
  
- **`path`**: The path to the health check endpoint that will be used to determine the status of the service instance. The default value is usually `/actuator/health`, but it can be customized to any endpoint that returns the health status.

- **`initial-delay`**: Defines the delay (in milliseconds) before the first health check is performed after the application starts. In the example, the first health check will be performed after 10 seconds (`10000` milliseconds).

- **`refetch-instances`**: A boolean flag that indicates whether to refetch the service instances from the service registry (like Eureka) before each health check. Setting it to `false` can reduce the load on the service registry, but it means that instances will only be fetched once at the beginning.

- **`success-threshold`**: The number of consecutive successful health checks required to mark an instance as healthy. In the example, an instance will be considered healthy after 3 consecutive successful checks.

- **`failure-threshold`**: The number of consecutive failed health checks required to mark an instance as unhealthy. An instance will be considered unhealthy after 3 consecutive failed checks.

### Java-Based Configuration Example

To achieve a similar setup with Java-based configuration:

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.loadbalancer.core.HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.ServiceInstance;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.DiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.loadbalancer.reactive.ReactorServiceInstanceLoadBalancer;
import org.springframework.cloud.loadbalancer.annotation.LoadBalancerClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.loadbalancer.config.LoadBalancerZoneConfig;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary;
import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;

@Configuration
@LoadBalancerClient(name = "product-service", configuration = CustomLoadBalancerConfiguration.class)
public class CustomLoadBalancerConfiguration {

    @Bean
    @Primary
    public HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier healthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier(
            DiscoveryClient discoveryClient, Environment environment) {
        return new HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier(
                ServiceInstanceListSupplier.builder()
                        .withDiscoveryClient()
                        .withHealthChecks()
                        .build(environment), 
                new DefaultHealthCheckListener(), 30000);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **`HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier`**: This bean provides the service instances list with health checks enabled. It uses the `DiscoveryClient` to fetch instances and wraps the list supplier with health checks.
  
- **`ServiceInstanceListSupplier.builder().withDiscoveryClient().withHealthChecks().build(environment)`**: Builds a supplier for service instances with health checks enabled.

- **`new DefaultHealthCheckListener()`**: A default listener to handle health check results.

### Benefits of Using Health Checks in Load Balancing

1. **Improved Reliability**: Health checks help to avoid routing traffic to instances that are down or unhealthy, improving overall system reliability.
2. **Dynamic Resilience**: The system can dynamically adapt to changes in instance health, automatically routing traffic to only the healthy instances.
3. **Better Performance**: Prevents unnecessary delays and failures by avoiding calls to unhealthy instances, thus improving overall performance.
4. **Automatic Failover**: Ensures that instances marked as unhealthy are excluded from routing, thereby providing automatic failover capability.

By configuring `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.configurations: health-check`, you can ensure that your load balancer only routes requests to healthy instances, enhancing the robustness and responsiveness of your microservices architecture.
