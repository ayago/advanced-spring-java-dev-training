# API Gateway via Spring Cloud Gateway

Spring Cloud Gateway is a lightweight, highly configurable API Gateway built on top of Spring Framework and Project Reactor. It provides a way to route and filter requests to various microservices in a cloud-native architecture. The gateway serves as a single entry point into a system, handling all API requests, applying cross-cutting concerns like security, monitoring, and rate limiting, and directing traffic to the appropriate backend services.

## Basic Configuration

Configure Spring Cloud Gateway to route requests to specific backend services using a static list of client instances. This example does not rely on a service registry like Eureka but uses predefined URIs for the services.

#### Step 1: Add Dependencies

Make sure to include the following dependencies in your `pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle:

**Maven (`pom.xml`):**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Step 2: Define Static Client Instances in `application.yml`

Configure the Spring Cloud Gateway with static routes pointing to the specific backend service instances.

**`application.yml`:**

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080

spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: order-service
          uri: http://localhost:8081  # Static URI for order service instance
          predicates:
            - Path=/orders/**
          filters:
            - RewritePath=/orders/(?<segment>.*), /${segment}
        - id: product-service
          uri: http://localhost:8082  # Static URI for product service instance
          predicates:
            - Path=/products/**
          filters:
            - RewritePath=/products/(?<segment>.*), /${segment}
```

#### Explanation:

1. **`server.port`**: Sets the port for the Spring Cloud Gateway application, which is `8080` in this example.

2. **`spring.cloud.gateway.routes`**: Defines a list of routes that the gateway will handle. Each route specifies:
   - **`id`**: A unique identifier for the route (e.g., `order-service`).
   - **`uri`**: The static URI of the backend service. Instead of using a load-balanced URI (`lb://`), we specify a direct URI (`http://localhost:8081` for `order-service` and `http://localhost:8082` for `product-service`).
   - **`predicates`**: Conditions that must be met for the route to be selected. Here, `Path=/orders/**` means this route will handle all requests that start with `/orders`.
   - **`filters`**: Optional filters that modify the request before it is forwarded to the backend service. `RewritePath` is used to remove the `/orders` or `/products` prefix from the path.

#### Step 3: Create the Gateway Application

**`GatewayApplication.java`:**

```java
package com.example.gateway;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class GatewayApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(GatewayApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **`@SpringBootApplication`**: The main class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` is the entry point for the Spring Boot application. When you run this application, it starts an embedded web server (e.g., Tomcat) on port `8080` and configures the routes defined in `application.yml`.

### Step 4: Start the Backend Services

Ensure that your backend services (`order-service` and `product-service`) are running on `localhost` ports `8081` and `8082` respectively. You can create simple Spring Boot applications for these services to handle requests on the `/orders` and `/products` endpoints.

#### Summary:

- This configuration provides a static setup where each route has a fixed backend URI.
- The gateway uses predefined routes to forward requests to specific service instances, making it suitable for simple environments without a dynamic service registry like Eureka.
- Changes to service URIs require an update to `application.yml` and a restart of the gateway application. 

This approach offers simplicity and is ideal for small setups or development environments where services are relatively static.

## Achieving the Key Responsibilities mentioned in first topic

### 1. **Request Routing**

To route requests to different microservices based on the path or request criteria, use route definitions in the `application.yml` file.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: order-service
          uri: lb://ORDER-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/orders/**
        - id: product-service
          uri: lb://PRODUCT-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/products/**
```

**Explanation:**
- The `Path` predicate routes requests with `/orders/**` to the `ORDER-SERVICE` and `/products/**` to the `PRODUCT-SERVICE`. 
- `lb://` indicates that Spring Cloud Gateway should use the load balancer to resolve service instances.

---

### 2. **Load Balancing**

Spring Cloud Gateway supports client-side load balancing by using Spring Cloud LoadBalancer. Configure it to load balance between instances of a microservice.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      discovery:
        locator:
          enabled: true
```

**Explanation:**
- Enabling `discovery.locator` allows the gateway to dynamically discover routes based on service registry (e.g., Eureka). This automatically load-balances traffic to the discovered instances.

---

### 3. **Authentication and Authorization**

Integrate with OAuth2 or JWT to handle authentication and authorization.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: secure-route
          uri: lb://SECURE-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/secure/**
          filters:
            - OAuth2AuthorizationGatewayFilter
```

**Explanation:**
- Use `OAuth2AuthorizationGatewayFilter` to secure routes by validating OAuth2 tokens. The gateway checks the validity of the token before forwarding the request.

---

### 4. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**

Configure rate limiting using Redis or in-memory rate limiting filters.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: rate-limited-route
          uri: lb://LIMITED-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/limited/**
          filters:
            - name: RequestRateLimiter
              args:
                redis-rate-limiter.replenishRate: 10
                redis-rate-limiter.burstCapacity: 20
```

**Explanation:**
- `RequestRateLimiter` filter uses Redis to limit the rate of requests. `replenishRate` defines the number of requests per second allowed, and `burstCapacity` defines the maximum number of requests in a burst.

---

### 5. **API Aggregation**

Aggregate responses from multiple microservices into a single response.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: aggregate-route
          uri: http://localhost:8080/aggregate
          predicates:
            - Path=/aggregate/**
          filters:
            - name: ModifyResponseBody
              args:
                new-content-type: application/json
                modify-response-body: |
                  [{"service": "ORDER-SERVICE", "data": "#{@orderService.getOrders()}"}, {"service": "PRODUCT-SERVICE", "data": "#{@productService.getProducts()}"}]
```

**Explanation:**
- `ModifyResponseBody` is used to transform multiple microservice responses into a single aggregated JSON response.

---

### 6. **Caching**

Cache the response from microservices to reduce load and improve response times.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: cache-route
          uri: lb://CACHED-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/cached/**
          filters:
            - name: CacheRequestBody
              args:
                ttl: 60  # Cache Time-To-Live in seconds
```

**Explanation:**
- `CacheRequestBody` caches the response for a specified time (`ttl`). This reduces load on the backend microservices and speeds up the response for repetitive requests.

---

### 7. **Request and Response Transformation**

Transform requests or responses using built-in filters.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: transform-route
          uri: lb://TRANSFORM-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/transform/**
          filters:
            - AddRequestHeader=X-Custom-Header, CustomValue
            - RewriteResponseHeader=X-Response-Header, CustomResponseValue
```

**Explanation:**
- `AddRequestHeader` adds custom headers to requests.
- `RewriteResponseHeader` modifies the response headers before sending them back to the client.

---

### 8. **Logging and Monitoring**

Enable logging and monitoring using `GlobalFilter` for observing traffic.

```java
@Bean
public GlobalFilter loggingFilter() {
    return (exchange, chain) -> {
        ServerHttpRequest request = exchange.getRequest();
        log.info("Request Path: {}", request.getURI());
        return chain.filter(exchange).then(Mono.fromRunnable(() -> {
            log.info("Response Code: {}", exchange.getResponse().getStatusCode());
        }));
    };
}
```

**Explanation:**
- A `GlobalFilter` captures all incoming requests and outgoing responses, logging relevant details for monitoring and analysis.

---

### 9. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**

Configure CORS policies for specific routes.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      globalcors:
        cors-configurations:
          '[/**]':
            allowedOrigins: "http://allowed-origin.com"
            allowedMethods:
              - GET
              - POST
```

**Explanation:**
- Configures CORS settings to allow specific HTTP methods and origins, enhancing security by controlling cross-domain requests.

---

### 10. **Circuit Breaking and Fallbacks**

Use circuit breaker filters to provide fallback mechanisms when a service is unavailable.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: circuit-breaker-route
          uri: lb://UNSTABLE-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/unstable/**
          filters:
            - name: CircuitBreaker
              args:
                name: myCircuitBreaker
                fallbackUri: forward:/fallback
```

**Explanation:**
- The `CircuitBreaker` filter monitors the service and trips if the service fails too frequently. When triggered, requests are forwarded to the `/fallback` endpoint.
