# The Spring Framework

## Spring Core

Spring Core is the foundational module of the Spring Framework. It provides the core functionality of dependency injection (DI) and inversion of control (IoC). The core container includes the `ApplicationContext`, which is responsible for managing the lifecycle and configuration of beans. Spring Core simplifies Java enterprise application development by promoting loose coupling and increased testability.

## Key Concepts

- **Dependency Injection (DI):** A design pattern where an objectâ€™s dependencies are provided by an external entity rather than the object managing them itself.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC):** A principle where the control flow of the program is inverted, meaning that the framework calls your code instead of your code calling the framework.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** A programming paradigm that allows cross-cutting concerns (like logging or security) to be separated from the business logic.

## Inversion of Control (IoC)

IoC is the backbone of Spring, allowing the framework to manage the creation and lifecycle of objects (beans) within an application. IoC is achieved through Dependency Injection, where the framework injects dependencies into an object at runtime, thus decoupling object creation from the application logic.

### Types of Dependency Injection:
- **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are provided through the class constructor.
- **Setter Injection:** Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
- **Field Injection:** Dependencies are directly injected into fields using annotations like `@Autowired`.

## Core Components

- **BeanFactory:** The simplest container providing the basic dependency injection capabilities. It lazily instantiates beans.
- **ApplicationContext:** A more advanced container that builds on `BeanFactory`. It eagerly instantiates beans and provides additional features like event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create a bean, and AOP.

## Spring Bean

A Spring Bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container. Beans are defined using XML, Java annotations, or Java configuration classes.

### Example:
```java
@Component
public class MyService {
    // Bean managed by Spring
}
```

## Bean Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a Spring Bean is managed by the Spring container. Key stages include:

1. **Instantiation:** The container instantiates the bean.
2. **Populate Properties:** Dependencies are injected into the bean.
3. **Bean Name Aware:** If `BeanNameAware` is implemented, the factory calls `setBeanName()`.
4. **Bean Factory Aware:** If `BeanFactoryAware` is implemented, the factory calls `setBeanFactory()`.
5. **Pre Initialization (`@PostConstruct`):** Custom initialization logic.
6. **After Properties Set:** If `InitializingBean` is implemented, `afterPropertiesSet()` is called.
7. **Custom Init Method:** A user-defined initialization method.
8. **Bean Ready:** The bean is fully initialized and ready for use.
9. **Destruction (`@PreDestroy`):** Custom cleanup logic.
10. **Custom Destroy Method:** A user-defined destroy method.

## Bean Configuration

Beans can be configured in multiple ways:

- **XML-Based Configuration:** Beans are defined in XML configuration files.
- **Annotation-Based Configuration:** Beans are defined using annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.
- **Java-Based Configuration:** Beans are defined using `@Configuration` classes with `@Bean` annotated methods.

## Spring Boot Features

Spring Boot simplifies the development of Spring-based applications by providing:

- **Auto Configuration:** Automatically configures your Spring application based on the dependencies present on the classpath.
- **Starter POMs:** Pre-configured dependencies for various functionalities, reducing boilerplate.
- **Spring Boot CLI:** Command-line tool for running Spring Boot applications.
- **Embedded Servers:** Spring Boot provides embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, allowing you to run your application as a standalone service.
- **Spring Boot Actuator:** Provides production-ready features such as monitoring, metrics, and health checks.
