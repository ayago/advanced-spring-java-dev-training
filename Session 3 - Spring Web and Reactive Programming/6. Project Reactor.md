# Project Reactor

Project Reactor is a reactive programming library for Java, developed by Pivotal (now part of VMware). It provides support for building non-blocking, asynchronous applications using reactive streams. Project Reactor is a foundational library used by Spring WebFlux for creating reactive applications and handling asynchronous data streams.

## Core Concepts of Project Reactor

1. **Reactive Types**
   Project Reactor introduces two primary reactive types:
   - **`Mono<T>`**: Represents a single or empty asynchronous value. It is used for operations that yield zero or one result.
   - **`Flux<T>`**: Represents a sequence of asynchronous values. It is used for operations that yield zero or more results.

2. **Reactive Streams API**
   Project Reactor implements the Reactive Streams specification, which defines a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure. The core interfaces are:
   - **`Publisher`**: Emits data to `Subscriber`.
   - **`Subscriber`**: Consumes data from `Publisher`.
   - **`Subscription`**: Manages the subscription between `Publisher` and `Subscriber`.
   - **`Processor`**: Acts as both `Publisher` and `Subscriber`.

3. **Operators**
   Project Reactor provides a rich set of operators for transforming, filtering, combining, and handling reactive streams. These operators enable powerful and flexible stream processing.

4. **Schedulers**
   Schedulers in Project Reactor control the execution context of reactive streams. They determine on which thread the reactive operations are executed.

5. **Backpressure**
   Backpressure is a mechanism to handle situations where the rate of data production exceeds the rate of consumption. Project Reactor provides operators to manage backpressure effectively.

## Key Components and Operators in Project Reactor

1. **`Mono<T>`**
   Represents a single value or empty result. Common methods include `subscribe`, `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, and `onErrorResume`.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   Mono<String> singleValue = Mono.just("Hello");
   singleValue.map(value -> value + " World")
              .subscribe(System.out::println); // Output: Hello World
   ```

2. **`Flux<T>`**
   Represents a stream of multiple values. Common methods include `subscribe`, `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, `merge`, and `combineLatest`.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 5);
   numbers.map(n -> n * 2)
          .filter(n -> n % 3 == 0)
          .subscribe(System.out::println); // Output: 6
   ```

3. **Common Operators**

   - **`map`**: Transforms each item emitted by a `Mono` or `Flux`.

     **Sample Code:**
     ```java
     Flux<String> names = Flux.just("John", "Jane");
     Flux<String> upperCaseNames = names.map(String::toUpperCase);
     ```

   - **`flatMap`**: Transforms each item into a `Publisher` and merges the results.

     **Sample Code:**
     ```java
     Flux<String> names = Flux.just("John", "Jane");
     Flux<String> greetings = names.flatMap(name -> Mono.just("Hello, " + name));
     ```

   - **`filter`**: Filters items emitted by the source `Mono` or `Flux`.

     **Sample Code:**
     ```java
     Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 10);
     Flux<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.filter(n -> n % 2 == 0);
     ```

   - **`merge`**: Combines multiple `Mono` or `Flux` sources into a single `Flux`.

     **Sample Code:**
     ```java
     Flux<Integer> numbers1 = Flux.just(1, 2, 3);
     Flux<Integer> numbers2 = Flux.just(4, 5, 6);
     Flux<Integer> merged = Flux.merge(numbers1, numbers2);
     ```

   - **`combineLatest`**: Combines the latest items emitted by multiple `Flux` sources.

     **Sample Code:**
     ```java
     Flux<String> names = Flux.just("John", "Jane");
     Flux<Integer> ages = Flux.just(30, 25);
     Flux<Tuple2<String, Integer>> combined = Flux.combineLatest(names, ages, Tuple2::new);
     ```

   - **`onErrorResume`**: Provides an alternative `Mono` or `Flux` to return in case of an error.

     **Sample Code:**
     ```java
     Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.just(1, 2, 3)
                                  .concatWith(Flux.error(new RuntimeException("Error!")));
     Flux<Integer> fallback = numbers.onErrorResume(e -> Flux.just(-1, -2, -3));
     ```

4. **Schedulers**

   Schedulers manage the threading and execution context for reactive operations. Common schedulers include `Schedulers.parallel()`, `Schedulers.single()`, and `Schedulers.boundedElastic()`.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 10);
   numbers.subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
          .map(n -> n * 2)
          .publishOn(Schedulers.parallel())
          .subscribe(System.out::println);
   ```

5. **Backpressure Management**

   Reactive streams handle backpressure using strategies like buffering, dropping, or throttling.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 1000);
   numbers.onBackpressureBuffer(100) // Buffer up to 100 items
          .subscribe(System.out::println);
   ```

## Using Project Reactor in Spring

Project Reactor integrates seamlessly with Spring WebFlux for building reactive web applications. It allows you to build responsive and efficient applications that handle a high volume of requests with non-blocking operations.

**Sample Reactive WebFlux Controller:**
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/products")
public class ProductReactiveController {

    private final ProductService productService;

    public ProductReactiveController(ProductService productService) {
        this.productService = productService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Mono<ResponseEntity<Product>> getProductById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return productService.findById(id)
                             .map(product -> ResponseEntity.ok(product))
                             .defaultIfEmpty(ResponseEntity.notFound().build());
    }

    @GetMapping
    public Flux<Product> getAllProducts() {
        return productService.findAll();
    }
}
```

## Summary

Project Reactor provides the foundation for reactive programming in Java, offering `Mono` and `Flux` types for handling asynchronous data streams. By leveraging reactive operators, schedulers, and backpressure management, Project Reactor enables developers to build highly responsive and scalable applications. Its integration with Spring WebFlux facilitates the development of non-blocking web services that handle concurrent requests efficiently.
