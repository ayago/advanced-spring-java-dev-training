# Reactive Streams

**Reactive Streams** is a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure. It was initiated to provide a consistent API for handling asynchronous data streams in a way that allows different libraries and frameworks to work together seamlessly. Reactive Streams is a specification developed by the Reactive Streams initiative, defining the interfaces and rules for asynchronous stream processing in Java.

## Core Goals of Reactive Streams

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Handle data streams asynchronously without blocking threads, allowing for efficient use of system resources.
2. **Backpressure**: Provide a mechanism to handle situations where the producer is faster than the consumer, preventing system overload.
3. **Interoperability**: Define a common set of interfaces and protocols that libraries and frameworks can implement to ensure compatibility.

## Core Interfaces in Reactive Streams

Reactive Streams defines four key interfaces:

1. **`Publisher<T>`**
   - Represents a source of data. The `Publisher` emits data to one or more `Subscribers`.
   - Has a single method `subscribe(Subscriber<? super T> s)` to connect to a `Subscriber`.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   public interface Publisher<T> {
       void subscribe(Subscriber<? super T> s);
   }
   ```

2. **`Subscriber<T>`**
   - Consumes data from a `Publisher`. The `Subscriber` defines four methods to handle different stages of data consumption:
     - `onSubscribe(Subscription s)`: Called when the `Subscriber` is subscribed to a `Publisher`.
     - `onNext(T t)`: Called for each item emitted by the `Publisher`.
     - `onError(Throwable t)`: Called when an error occurs.
     - `onComplete()`: Called when all items have been emitted and processed successfully.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   public interface Subscriber<T> {
       void onSubscribe(Subscription s);
       void onNext(T t);
       void onError(Throwable t);
       void onComplete();
   }
   ```

3. **`Subscription`**
   - Represents a connection between a `Publisher` and a `Subscriber`. The `Subscription` allows the `Subscriber` to request items and cancel the subscription.
   - Key methods:
     - `request(long n)`: Requests the `Publisher` to emit `n` more items.
     - `cancel()`: Cancels the subscription.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   public interface Subscription {
       void request(long n);
       void cancel();
   }
   ```

4. **`Processor<T, R>`**
   - Acts as both a `Publisher` and a `Subscriber`. It can consume data from one source and publish it to another.
   - It is used to transform or process data in the stream.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   public interface Processor<T, R> extends Subscriber<T>, Publisher<R> {
   }
   ```

## Example of Reactive Streams Usage

To illustrate the use of Reactive Streams, here is a simple example of a custom `Publisher` and `Subscriber` in Java:

**Custom Publisher Example:**
```java
public class SimplePublisher implements Publisher<Integer> {
    private final List<Integer> data = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

    @Override
    public void subscribe(Subscriber<? super Integer> subscriber) {
        subscriber.onSubscribe(new SimpleSubscription(subscriber, data));
    }
}

class SimpleSubscription implements Subscription {
    private final Subscriber<? super Integer> subscriber;
    private final List<Integer> data;
    private int currentIndex = 0;

    public SimpleSubscription(Subscriber<? super Integer> subscriber, List<Integer> data) {
        this.subscriber = subscriber;
        this.data = data;
    }

    @Override
    public void request(long n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n && currentIndex < data.size(); i++) {
            subscriber.onNext(data.get(currentIndex++));
        }
        if (currentIndex == data.size()) {
            subscriber.onComplete();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void cancel() {
        // Clean up resources or handle cancellation.
    }
}
```

**Custom Subscriber Example:**
```java
public class SimpleSubscriber implements Subscriber<Integer> {
    private Subscription subscription;

    @Override
    public void onSubscribe(Subscription s) {
        this.subscription = s;
        subscription.request(2); // Request the first 2 items
    }

    @Override
    public void onNext(Integer item) {
        System.out.println("Received: " + item);
        subscription.request(1); // Request the next item after processing
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable t) {
        System.err.println("Error occurred: " + t.getMessage());
    }

    @Override
    public void onComplete() {
        System.out.println("All items processed.");
    }
}
```

**Usage Example:**
```java
public class ReactiveStreamsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Publisher<Integer> publisher = new SimplePublisher();
        Subscriber<Integer> subscriber = new SimpleSubscriber();
        publisher.subscribe(subscriber);
    }
}
```

## Backpressure in Reactive Streams

**Backpressure** is a key feature of Reactive Streams that helps manage situations where a `Publisher` emits items faster than a `Subscriber` can consume them. It allows the `Subscriber` to control the rate of data consumption by requesting a specific number of items or cancelling the subscription if it cannot keep up.

- **`request(n)`**: The `Subscriber` requests `n` items from the `Publisher`.
- **`cancel()`**: The `Subscriber` can cancel the subscription if it no longer wants to receive items.

## Integration with Project Reactor

Project Reactor is an implementation of the Reactive Streams specification. It provides a rich set of operators and utilities for working with reactive types (`Mono` and `Flux`), offering seamless integration with the Reactive Streams API.

**Example with Project Reactor:**
```java
Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 5);
flux.map(n -> n * 2)
    .subscribe(System.out::println, // onNext
               System.err::println,  // onError
               () -> System.out.println("Completed")); // onComplete
```

## Key Advantages of Reactive Streams

1. **Non-blocking and Asynchronous**: Efficient handling of data streams without blocking threads.
2. **Backpressure Support**: Ability to handle varying rates of data production and consumption.
3. **Interoperability**: Ensures compatibility between different reactive libraries and frameworks.
4. **Scalability**: Suitable for building applications that handle a large number of concurrent users or events.

## Summary

Reactive Streams provides a standard API for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure. By defining core interfaces (`Publisher`, `Subscriber`, `Subscription`, and `Processor`), it enables efficient handling of data streams in a way that can be adopted by different libraries and frameworks, such as Project Reactor. This model offers significant advantages in building scalable, high-performance applications that can handle real-time data processing requirements effectively.
