# Reactive Programming

Reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm that deals with data streams and the propagation of changes. It is designed to handle events, messages, and data in a non-blocking and event-driven manner. This approach is particularly useful for applications that require high concurrency, real-time data processing, or scalable performance.

Reactive programming is built around the concept of reactive streams, which are sequences of data items that are processed asynchronously. The core principles involve working with streams of data that can be observed and reacted to, rather than traditional imperative programming where you deal with one task at a time.

## Core Concepts in Reactive Programming

1. **Reactive Streams**
   Reactive streams are the foundation of reactive programming. They provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure. Reactive streams are defined by four key interfaces:
   - **Publisher**: Produces data.
   - **Subscriber**: Consumes data.
   - **Subscription**: Manages the connection between publisher and subscriber.
   - **Processor**: Acts as both a publisher and a subscriber.

2. **Mono and Flux**
   In Project Reactor, which is a library used by Spring WebFlux, there are two main reactive types:
   - **Mono**: Represents a sequence that contains zero or one item. It is used for single-value asynchronous operations.
   - **Flux**: Represents a sequence that can contain zero to many items. It is used for multi-value asynchronous operations.

3. **Operators**
   Reactive operators are functions that transform, filter, combine, and manipulate reactive streams. Examples include `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, `merge`, and `combineLatest`.

4. **Backpressure**
   Backpressure is a mechanism to handle situations where a subscriber cannot keep up with the rate of data emission by a publisher. Reactive streams provide ways to manage backpressure, ensuring that systems remain responsive even under load.

5. **Schedulers**
   Schedulers in reactive programming are used to manage the execution context of reactive streams. They control on which thread the reactive operations are executed.

## Key Operators in Reactive Programming

1. **`map`**
   Transforms each item emitted by the source `Mono` or `Flux` into another item.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.just(1, 2, 3);
   Flux<Integer> squared = numbers.map(n -> n * n);
   ```

2. **`flatMap`**
   Transforms each item emitted by the source `Mono` or `Flux` into a `Publisher` and merges the items emitted by the resulting `Publishers`.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   Flux<String> names = Flux.just("John", "Jane");
   Flux<String> greetings = names.flatMap(name -> Mono.just("Hello, " + name));
   ```

3. **`filter`**
   Filters items emitted by the source `Mono` or `Flux` based on a predicate.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
   Flux<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.filter(n -> n % 2 == 0);
   ```

4. **`merge`**
   Combines multiple `Mono` or `Flux` sources into a single `Flux` that emits all items from the sources.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   Flux<Integer> numbers1 = Flux.just(1, 2, 3);
   Flux<Integer> numbers2 = Flux.just(4, 5, 6);
   Flux<Integer> merged = Flux.merge(numbers1, numbers2);
   ```

5. **`combineLatest`**
   Combines the latest items emitted by multiple `Flux` sources.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   Flux<String> names = Flux.just("John", "Jane");
   Flux<Integer> ages = Flux.just(30, 25);
   Flux<Tuple2<String, Integer>> combined = Flux.combineLatest(names, ages, Tuple2::new);
   ```

6. **`onErrorResume`**
   Provides an alternative `Mono` or `Flux` to return in case of an error.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.just(1, 2, 3)
                                .concatWith(Flux.error(new RuntimeException("Error!")));
   Flux<Integer> fallback = numbers.onErrorResume(e -> Flux.just(-1, -2, -3));
   ```

7. **`doOnNext`**
   Allows performing side effects for each item emitted by the source `Mono` or `Flux`.

   **Sample Code:**
   ```java
   Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.just(1, 2, 3);
   numbers.doOnNext(n -> System.out.println("Received: " + n))
          .subscribe();
   ```

## Reactive Programming with Spring WebFlux

**Creating Reactive Endpoints**

In Spring WebFlux, you use reactive types (`Mono` and `Flux`) to create reactive endpoints that handle asynchronous requests.

**Sample Code:**
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/orders")
public class OrderReactiveController {

    private final OrderService orderService;

    public OrderReactiveController(OrderService orderService) {
        this.orderService = orderService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Mono<ResponseEntity<Order>> getOrderById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return orderService.findById(id)
                           .map(order -> ResponseEntity.ok(order))
                           .defaultIfEmpty(ResponseEntity.notFound().build());
    }

    @GetMapping
    public Flux<Order> getAllOrders() {
        return orderService.findAll();
    }
}
```

**Handling Reactive Data Streams**

Reactive data streams enable handling real-time data and complex data transformations efficiently.

**Sample Code:**
```java
public Flux<Order> getOrdersByStatus(String status) {
    return orderRepository.findByStatus(status)
                          .map(order -> {
                              order.setDescription(order.getDescription().toUpperCase());
                              return order;
                          });
}
```

**Backpressure Management**

Properly managing backpressure ensures that the system remains responsive under high load.

**Sample Code:**
```java
Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 1000);
numbers.onBackpressureBuffer(100) // Buffer up to 100 items
       .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

**Schedulers**

Schedulers are used to control the execution context of reactive streams.

**Sample Code:**
```java
Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 10);
numbers.subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
       .map(n -> n * 2)
       .publishOn(Schedulers.parallel())
       .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

## Summary

Reactive programming, enabled by libraries like Project Reactor and frameworks like Spring WebFlux, offers a powerful model for building scalable, non-blocking applications. By using reactive types such as `Mono` and `Flux`, operators to handle data streams, and managing backpressure, developers can create highly responsive and efficient systems that handle asynchronous data effectively.
