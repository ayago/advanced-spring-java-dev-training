# Minikube

## Configuring a cluster with multiple nodes

1. `minikube start --nodes # -p <cluster_name>`
2. **Label nodes as worker nodes**: `kubectl label node <node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker`
3. **Apply kev:value label on worker nodes**: `kubectl label nodes <node_name> role=worker`



## Issues

### Persistent Volumn not reflecting in local folder

The behavior you're experiencing occurs because Minikube uses a Virtual Machine (VM) or a container to simulate a Kubernetes cluster. When you define a `PersistentVolume` using the `hostPath` type, the specified path (`/logs/order-management`) is referring to the filesystem **inside** the Minikube VM or container, not your local machine's filesystem.

In your example, the host path specified is a path on your local machine, but Minikube treats it as a path **inside the Minikube VM**. This is why you can see the logs when you SSH into Minikube (`minikube ssh`) but not on your local filesystem.

#### How to Fix It

1. **Mount Local Directory into Minikube VM**
To use a local directory from your host machine (macOS in this case) and make it accessible within Minikube, you need to mount it explicitly when starting Minikube.

You can use the `minikube mount` command to achieve this.

Example:
```bash
minikube mount /logs/order-management:/mnt/data
```

This mounts the local directory to `/mnt/data` inside the Minikube VM. Now you can update your PersistentVolume definition to reference this path inside Minikube:

**Updated `PersistentVolume` YAML:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: order-management-pv
  namespace: default
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 2Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"  # Updated to the mount path inside Minikube
  storageClassName: standard
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
```

2. **Access from Host Machine**
After this setup, files created within the Pod using this PersistentVolume will be written to `/mnt/data` inside the Minikube VM, and they will also appear in `/logs/order-management` on your host machine.

1. **Restart Minikube with Mount**
When restarting Minikube, always remember to remount the directory:
```bash
minikube mount /Users/adriancyago/Projects/advanced-spring-java-dev-training/logs/order-management:/mnt/data
```

Alternatively, you can automate this process by adding the mount as part of your Minikube startup commands.

#### Key Points:
- **`hostPath` volumes** refer to the Minikube VM or container filesystem, not your local machine.
- **Use `minikube mount`** to map a local directory to the Minikube VM, making it accessible to your PersistentVolume.
- Ensure the path inside the Minikube VM matches the path in the `PersistentVolume` spec.

This should allow you to persist data in your local directory and make it available both in Minikube and on your host machine.
