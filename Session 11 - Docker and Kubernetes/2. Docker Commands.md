# Docker Commands Aligned with Microservices Development

Microservices rely heavily on containerization, and Docker provides an excellent toolset to create, manage, and deploy containerized applications. Below is a list of Docker commands essential for managing microservices in a containerized environment.

### 1. `docker build`
This command builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile. In microservices development, you typically create a separate image for each service.

**Example:**
```bash
docker build -t my-service:1.0 .
```
- `-t`: Tags the image with a name (`my-service`) and version (`1.0`).
- `.`: Specifies the build context (current directory).

### 2. `docker run`
This command runs a container from a Docker image. For microservices, each service typically runs in its own container.

**Example:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name my-service-container my-service:1.0
```
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode.
- `-p 8080:8080`: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 8080 in the container.
- `--name`: Names the running container for easier management.

### 3. `docker stop` and `docker start`
These commands stop and start containers. Microservices are often part of complex deployments, and you may need to stop/start individual services.

**Example:**
```bash
docker stop my-service-container
docker start my-service-container
```

### 4. `docker ps` and `docker ps -a`
These commands list running containers and all containers (including stopped ones), respectively.

**Example:**
```bash
docker ps         # List active containers
docker ps -a      # List all containers
```

### 5. `docker logs`
This command retrieves logs from a running container, which is essential for debugging microservices.

**Example:**
```bash
docker logs my-service-container
```

### 6. `docker exec`
This command runs a new command in a running container. For microservices, you might need to access a container to inspect the environment or run debugging tools.

**Example:**
```bash
docker exec -it my-service-container /bin/bash
```
- `-it`: Runs in interactive mode and allocates a terminal.

### 7. `docker-compose`
For microservices, you often need to manage multiple containers simultaneously. `docker-compose` simplifies this by using a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and run multi-container Docker applications.

**Example:**
```bash
docker-compose up
```
- This command starts all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

**Example `docker-compose.yml`:**
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  product-service:
    image: product-service:1.0
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
  order-service:
    image: order-service:1.0
    ports:
      - "8082:8082"
```

### 8. `docker network`
Microservices need to communicate with each other, and Docker provides networking capabilities. You can create a custom network and ensure your services communicate on it.

**Example:**
```bash
docker network create my-network
docker run --network=my-network my-service:1.0
```

### 9. `docker volume`
Persistent storage is often required for microservices, especially for databases or services that need to store data across container restarts.

**Example:**
```bash
docker volume create my-volume
docker run -d -v my-volume:/data my-service:1.0
```

### 10. `docker pull` and `docker push`
For microservices, images are often shared through Docker Hub or private registries. Use `docker pull` to retrieve images and `docker push` to upload them.

**Example:**
```bash
docker pull myorg/my-service:1.0
docker push myorg/my-service:1.0
```

### 11. `docker rm` and `docker rmi`
These commands remove containers and images. After testing or updating services, it's important to clean up unused containers and images.

**Example:**
```bash
docker rm my-service-container
docker rmi my-service:1.0
```
