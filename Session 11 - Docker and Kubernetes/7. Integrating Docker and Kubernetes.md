# Integrating Docker and Kubernetes

## Dockerfile Overview

To get started with Kubernetes, you first need to containerize your application using Docker. Below is an example Dockerfile for a Spring Boot application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set a working directory for the application
WORKDIR /app

# Define the LOG_FILE_PARENT environment variable
ENV LOG_FILE_PARENT=/logs

# Create the directory structure for logs using the environment variable
RUN mkdir -p ${LOG_FILE_PARENT}/order-management-service

# Specify the mount point for external logging using the environment variable
VOLUME ${LOG_FILE_PARENT}/order-management-service

# Copy the JAR file from the build context
COPY target/order-management-service.jar /app/order-management-service.jar

# Expose necessary ports
# 8080 for HTTP communication, 15672 for RabbitMQ management UI (optional), 5672 for RabbitMQ messaging
EXPOSE 8080
EXPOSE 5672
EXPOSE 15672

# Set environment variables for JVM memory limits and Spring Boot active profile, reusing LOG_FILE_PARENT
ENV JAVA_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx1g -Dspring.profiles.active=prod -DLOG_FILE_PARENT=${LOG_FILE_PARENT}"

# Run the Spring Boot application with the specified JAVA_OPTS
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/order-management-service.jar", "${JAVA_OPTS}"]
```

## Key Components

- **Base Image**: The Dockerfile starts with `openjdk:17-jdk-slim` as the base image, which provides a lightweight JDK environment.
  
- **Working Directory**: `WORKDIR /app` sets the working directory inside the container where the application will reside.

- **Environment Variables**: `ENV LOG_FILE_PARENT=/logs` defines an environment variable for the logging directory. This variable is used later to create the directory structure and to specify the mount point for external logs.

- **Volume**: `VOLUME ${LOG_FILE_PARENT}/order-management-service` designates a mount point for external logs, allowing logs to be persisted or accessed from outside the container.

- **Copy**: `COPY target/order-management-service.jar /app/order-management-service.jar` copies the JAR file into the container.

- **Expose Ports**: `EXPOSE 8080 5672 15672` specifies the ports that the container will listen on. These ports correspond to HTTP communication, RabbitMQ messaging, and RabbitMQ management UI, respectively.

- **Java Options**: `ENV JAVA_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx1g -Dspring.profiles.active=prod -DLOG_FILE_PARENT=${LOG_FILE_PARENT}"` sets JVM options including memory limits and active profile.

- **Entry Point**: `ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/order-management-service.jar", "${JAVA_OPTS}"]` specifies the command to run the application.

## Deploying to Kubernetes

Once your Docker image is ready, you can deploy it to Kubernetes. Here are the steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image**: Build your Docker image using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-order-management-service .
   ```

2. **Push the Docker Image**: Push the image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry):
   ```bash
   docker tag my-order-management-service <your-registry>/my-order-management-service
   docker push <your-registry>/my-order-management-service
   ```

3. **Create Kubernetes Deployment**: Define a Kubernetes Deployment to manage the deployment of your application. Here’s an example YAML file (`order-management-service-deployment.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: order-management-service
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: order-management-service
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: order-management-service
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: order-management-service
             image: <your-registry>/my-order-management-service
             ports:
               - containerPort: 8080
             env:
               - name: LOG_FILE_PARENT
                 value: /logs
             volumeMounts:
               - name: logs
                 mountPath: /logs
         volumes:
           - name: logs
             emptyDir: {}
   ```

4. **Create Kubernetes Service**: Expose your application using a Kubernetes Service. Here’s an example YAML file (`order-management-service-service.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: order-management-service
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     selector:
       app: order-management-service
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
   ```

5. **Apply the Configuration**: Apply the configuration to your Kubernetes cluster:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f order-management-service-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f order-management-service-service.yaml
   ```

## Managing Configuration and Secrets in Kubernetes

### ConfigMap

Kubernetes ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from container images. This makes it easier to maintain and modify configuration without rebuilding your Docker images.

#### Creating a ConfigMap

You can use a ConfigMap to store non-sensitive configuration values such as `LOG_FILE_PARENT`, JVM memory settings (`XMS` and `XMX`), and the Spring profile. Here’s how to define a ConfigMap in a YAML file (`order-management-service-configmap.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: order-management-service-config
data:
  LOG_FILE_PARENT: "/logs"
  XMS: "256m"
  XMX: "1g"
  SPRING_PROFILE: "prod"
```

To create the ConfigMap in your Kubernetes cluster, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f order-management-service-configmap.yaml
```

### Secret

Kubernetes Secrets are designed to store sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth client secrets, and SSH keys. 

#### Creating a Secret

For example, you can create a Secret to store the OIDC client secret for your `order-management-service`. Here’s how to define a Secret in a YAML file (`order-management-service-secret.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: order-management-service-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  client-secret: <base64-encoded-client-secret>
```

To create the Secret, first, you need to base64 encode your client secret. You can use a command like `echo -n 'your-client-secret' | base64` to encode it. Replace `<base64-encoded-client-secret>` with the encoded value. Then, apply the YAML file:

```bash
kubectl apply -f order-management-service-secret.yaml
```

### Using ConfigMap and Secret in Deployment

Once you have created the ConfigMap and Secret, you can use them in your Deployment. Here’s an updated version of the Deployment YAML (`order-management-service-deployment.yaml`) that uses the ConfigMap and Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: order-management-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: order-management-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: order-management-service
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: order-management-service
          image: <your-registry>/my-order-management-service
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: LOG_FILE_PARENT
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: order-management-service-config
                  key: LOG_FILE_PARENT
            - name: JAVA_OPTS
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: order-management-service-config
                  key: XMS
                valueFrom:
                  configMapKeyRef:
                    name: order-management-service-config
                    key: XMX
            - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: order-management-service-config
                  key: SPRING_PROFILE
            - name: CLIENT_SECRET
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: order-management-service-secret
                  key: client-secret
          volumeMounts:
            - name: logs
              mountPath: /logs
      volumes:
        - name: logs
          emptyDir: {}
```

Here’s the updated Dockerfile that reflects the use of ConfigMaps and Secrets, as well as the adjustments needed to make use of environment variables injected by Kubernetes:

```dockerfile
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set a working directory for the application
WORKDIR /app

# Define the mount point for external logging
VOLUME /logs

# Copy the JAR file from the build context
COPY target/order-management-service.jar /app/order-management-service.jar

# Expose necessary ports
# 8080 for HTTP communication, 15672 for RabbitMQ management UI (optional), 5672 for RabbitMQ messaging
EXPOSE 8080
EXPOSE 5672
EXPOSE 15672

# Run the Spring Boot application with environment variables
ENTRYPOINT ["sh", "-c", "java -Xms${XMS} -Xmx${XMX} -Dspring.profiles.active=${SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE} -DLOG_FILE_PARENT=${LOG_FILE_PARENT} -jar /app/order-management-service.jar"]
```

### Key Changes

1. **Removed the `ENV` directive for `JAVA_OPTS`**: Instead of using `JAVA_OPTS` in the Dockerfile, we now use individual environment variables directly in the `ENTRYPOINT` command. This ensures that Kubernetes ConfigMap values are applied correctly.

2. **Modified `ENTRYPOINT`**: Used `sh -c` to allow for environment variable interpolation in the `java` command. This allows values from ConfigMap and Secrets to be dynamically applied.

### Usage in Kubernetes

The values for `LOG_FILE_PARENT`, `XMS`, `XMX`, and `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` will be injected into the container by Kubernetes via ConfigMap and Secrets. Ensure that you have the ConfigMap and Secret defined as shown earlier and that they are correctly referenced in your Deployment YAML.

This Dockerfile now integrates smoothly with Kubernetes configurations and keeps sensitive information secure while maintaining flexibility in configuration management.

---

### Summary

By using ConfigMaps and Secrets, you can effectively manage both configuration and sensitive data in your Kubernetes deployments:

- **ConfigMap**: Stores non-sensitive configuration values that your application can use to adjust its behavior. This keeps your application flexible and easier to update.
- **Secret**: Stores sensitive data like passwords or client secrets in a secure manner, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed.

Integrating these components into your deployment helps you maintain security and flexibility in your Kubernetes-managed applications.
