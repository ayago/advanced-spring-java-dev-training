# Spring Cloud Load Balancer

Spring Cloud Load Balancer provides a client-side load balancing mechanism for Spring-based applications. It helps distribute requests across multiple instances of a service, which is crucial for scaling microservices and improving resilience. Unlike server-side load balancers, which require additional infrastructure and management, client-side load balancers operate within the client applications themselves.

**Example:**

Suppose you have a microservices architecture where your `OrderService` needs to call a `ProductService`. Instead of hardcoding the `ProductService` instance, you use Spring Cloud Load Balancer to distribute calls among multiple instances of `ProductService`.

**Configuration:**

1. **Add Dependencies:**

   ```xml
   <!-- Add to your pom.xml -->
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Configure Load Balancer:**

   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class LoadBalancerConfig {
   
       @Bean
       public ServiceInstanceListSupplier serviceInstanceListSupplier(
           LoadBalancerClientFactory clientFactory) {
           return ServiceInstanceListSupplier.builder()
               .withDiscoveryClient()
               .withHint("product-service")
               .build(clientFactory.getLazyProvider("product-service", ServiceInstanceListSupplier.class));
       }
   
       @Bean
       public LoadBalancerClient loadBalancerClient(LoadBalancerClientFactory clientFactory) {
           return new LoadBalancerClient(clientFactory.getObject());
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Feign Client Example:**

   ```java
   @FeignClient(name = "product-service")
   public interface ProductServiceClient {
   
       @GetMapping("/products/{id}")
       Product getProductById(@PathVariable("id") Long id);
   }
   ```

**Explanation:**

In the above example:
- `ServiceInstanceListSupplier` is used to supply a list of instances of `product-service`.
- `LoadBalancerClient` is configured to use the provided `ServiceInstanceListSupplier`.
- The Feign client `ProductServiceClient` communicates with the `product-service` using client-side load balancing.

## Types of Load Balancers supported

Spring Cloud LoadBalancer provides several load balancing strategies out of the box. These strategies help distribute requests across instances of a service in different ways. Here are the primary types:

### 1. **Round Robin Load Balancer**

**Description:**
Distributes requests evenly across all available instances in a sequential manner. Once it reaches the end of the list, it starts again from the beginning.

**Use Case:**
Best for scenarios where you want to evenly distribute traffic without considering instance health or load.

**Pros:**
- Simple and easy to implement.
- Ensures even distribution of requests.

**Cons:**
- Does not consider the health or load of instances.
- May not be optimal if instances have varying capacities.

### 2. **Random Load Balancer**

**Description:**
Selects an instance at random for each request. This strategy provides an even distribution over time but is not guaranteed for each request.

**Use Case:**
Useful when you want a simple way to distribute traffic without considering instance health or performance.

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement.
- Provides a basic level of load distribution.

**Cons:**
- No consideration for instance health or current load.
- Requests may not be evenly distributed in the short term.

### 3. **Weighted Response Time Load Balancer**

**Description:**
Distributes requests based on the response times of each instance. Instances with lower response times are favored.

**Use Case:**
Ideal for scenarios where you want to minimize latency by directing traffic to faster instances.

**Pros:**
- Helps in improving overall performance by utilizing faster instances more.
- Reduces average response time.

**Cons:**
- Requires monitoring and accurate measurement of response times.
- Can be complex to configure and manage.

### 4. **Weighted Random Load Balancer**

**Description:**
Combines the random and weighted strategies. Instances are given weights, and the selection is based on these weights in a random manner.

**Use Case:**
Useful when you want to provide more traffic to instances with higher capacity while still introducing an element of randomness.

**Pros:**
- Balances traffic according to instance capacities.
- Incorporates randomness for distribution.

**Cons:**
- Configuration can be more complex.
- Random selection may still lead to uneven load distribution in some cases.

### 5. **Zone-Aware Load Balancer**

**Description:**
Distributes requests considering the availability of instances across different zones or regions. It helps in avoiding sending all requests to instances in the same zone.

**Use Case:**
Beneficial in multi-zone or multi-region deployments to improve fault tolerance and resilience.

**Pros:**
- Increases fault tolerance by spreading requests across zones.
- Improves resilience against zone-level failures.

**Cons:**
- More complex configuration.
- Requires proper setup of zone information.

### 6. **Custom Load Balancer**

**Description:**
Allows you to implement your own load balancing strategy by extending or modifying the provided strategies.

**Use Case:**
When default strategies do not fit your specific needs or when custom logic is required.

**Pros:**
- Tailored to specific requirements.
- Allows implementation of complex or unique load balancing algorithms.

**Cons:**
- Requires custom development and maintenance.
- Potentially more complex to implement and debug.
