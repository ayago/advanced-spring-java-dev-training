# Fallback Pattern

## Categorization: Reactive
The Fallback Pattern is classified as a reactive strategy because it provides a solution to handle failures dynamically. When a service call fails, the fallback mechanism is triggered to ensure the application can respond gracefully instead of simply failing.

## How the Strategy Works

The Fallback Pattern works by defining a backup or alternative response when a primary service call fails. This typically involves specifying a fallback method that will be executed in the event of an error or timeout during the execution of the main service call. This ensures that the system can still return a meaningful response, even if the primary service is unavailable or encounters an issue.

## Sample Application in Real Life

Consider an e-commerce platform where an application interacts with multiple microservices, such as a payment service, a product catalog service, and a shipping service. If the payment service becomes temporarily unavailable, the Fallback Pattern can be employed to provide a default response or an informative message to the user, ensuring that the user experience is not severely impacted. For example, instead of failing the checkout process entirely, the application could show a message indicating that the payment service is currently down and offer alternative ways to complete the transaction.

## Parameters Required to Make it Work

1. **Fallback Method Definition:** Specify a fallback method or response that will be used when the primary service call fails. This method should be designed to provide a sensible default response or alternative behavior.

2. **Exception Handling:** Define which exceptions or error conditions should trigger the fallback mechanism. This might include timeouts, service unavailability, or specific exceptions thrown by the service call.

3. **Timeout Settings:** Configure timeout settings to ensure that the fallback mechanism is triggered in a timely manner when the primary service is not responding within the expected time frame.

4. **Configuration:** Depending on the framework or library used, configure the fallback mechanism through annotations, configuration files, or programmatic setup. Ensure that the fallback logic is properly integrated into the service call flow.

5. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement monitoring and alerting to track the usage of fallback methods and identify patterns of service failures. This helps in understanding the reliability of the primary service and refining the fallback strategy as needed.
