# Introduction to Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker**

Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker provides an abstraction over popular circuit breaker implementations like Resilience4j, Hystrix, and Sentinel. It allows for handling failures gracefully by preventing requests to a failing service, providing fallback responses, and avoiding cascading failures across microservices.

**Underlying Principle**:
The Circuit Breaker pattern is used to detect failures and encapsulate the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring, during maintenance, temporary external system failure, or unexpected system difficulties. When the circuit breaker is "open," it stops making calls to the failing service and can return a fallback response or error. After a configured timeout, it will transition to a "half-open" state to check if the downstream service has recovered.

**Maven Dependency**:
To use Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker with Resilience4j:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-resilience4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**Minimal Code Example**:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.annotation.CircuitBreaker;

@RestController
public class CircuitBreakerController {

    @GetMapping("/example")
    @CircuitBreaker(name = "exampleService", fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public String exampleService() {
        // Simulate a call to a remote service
        throw new RuntimeException("Service failed");
    }

    public String fallback(Exception e) {
        return "Fallback response: Service is temporarily unavailable.";
    }
}
```

## Spring Cloud Starter Reactive Resilience4j

Reactive Resilience4j integrates with Project Reactor and provides reactive programming support for resilience patterns such as circuit breakers, rate limiters, bulkheads, and time limiters. This is particularly useful in reactive applications using WebFlux, where handling failures reactively is crucial to maintaining performance and responsiveness.

**Underlying Principle**:
Reactive programming leverages non-blocking asynchronous calls to improve performance in high-load scenarios. Reactive Resilience4j combines resilience patterns with reactive programming principles, allowing for fail-fast and responsive error handling without blocking the reactive pipeline.

**Maven Dependency**:
To use Reactive Resilience4j in a Maven project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-reactive-resilience4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**Minimal Code Example**:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;
import io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.annotation.CircuitBreaker;

@RestController
public class ReactiveCircuitBreakerController {

    @GetMapping("/reactive-example")
    @CircuitBreaker(name = "reactiveService", fallbackMethod = "reactiveFallback")
    public Mono<String> reactiveService() {
        // Simulate a call to a remote service
        return Mono.error(new RuntimeException("Reactive service failed"));
    }

    public Mono<String> reactiveFallback(Exception e) {
        return Mono.just("Fallback response: Reactive service is temporarily unavailable.");
    }
}
```

### Important configuration properties in Spring Boot Circuit Breaker

* **slidingWindowType():** specifies the type of circuit breaker. It could take one of these values: `SlidingWindowType.COUNT_BASED` or `SlidingWindowType.TIME_BASED`.
* **failureRateThreshold():** configure the failure rate threshold
* **slowCallRateThreshold():** configure the slow call rate threshold (%)
* **slowCallDurationThreshold():** configures the time beyond which a call is considered slow (seconds)
* **minimumNumberOfCalls():** specifies the minimum number of calls that are required before the circuit breaker can calculate the error rate or slow call rate
* **waitDurationInOpenState():** specifies the time that the circuit breaker should wait before switching to a half-open state
* **permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState():** configures the number of calls that will be allowed in the half-open state
* **maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState():** determines the amount of time a circuit breaker can stay in the half-open state before switching back to the open state
