# Fallback Pattern

## Categorization: Reactive
The Fallback Pattern is classified as a reactive strategy because it provides a solution to handle failures dynamically. When a service call fails, the fallback mechanism is triggered to ensure the application can respond gracefully instead of simply failing.

## How the Strategy Works

The Fallback Pattern works by defining a backup or alternative response when a primary service call fails. This typically involves specifying a fallback method that will be executed in the event of an error or timeout during the execution of the main service call. This ensures that the system can still return a meaningful response, even if the primary service is unavailable or encounters an issue.

## Sample Application in Real Life

Consider an e-commerce platform where an application interacts with multiple microservices, such as a payment service, a product catalog service, and a shipping service. If the payment service becomes temporarily unavailable, the Fallback Pattern can be employed to provide a default response or an informative message to the user, ensuring that the user experience is not severely impacted. For example, instead of failing the checkout process entirely, the application could show a message indicating that the payment service is currently down and offer alternative ways to complete the transaction.

## Parameters Required to Make it Work

1. **Fallback Method Definition:** Specify a fallback method or response that will be used when the primary service call fails. This method should be designed to provide a sensible default response or alternative behavior.

2. **Exception Handling:** Define which exceptions or error conditions should trigger the fallback mechanism. This might include timeouts, service unavailability, or specific exceptions thrown by the service call.

3. **Timeout Settings:** Configure timeout settings to ensure that the fallback mechanism is triggered in a timely manner when the primary service is not responding within the expected time frame.

4. **Configuration:** Depending on the framework or library used, configure the fallback mechanism through annotations, configuration files, or programmatic setup. Ensure that the fallback logic is properly integrated into the service call flow.

5. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement monitoring and alerting to track the usage of fallback methods and identify patterns of service failures. This helps in understanding the reliability of the primary service and refining the fallback strategy as needed.

## Sample Usage

You can use programmatic approaches to handle fallbacks with `Resilience4j` in your service class or configure a fallback mechanism externally.

### 1. Microservice with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer and Feign Client

#### Feign Client Interface
The Feign client is provided by an unmodifiable library:

```java
@FeignClient(name = "remoteService")
public interface RemoteServiceClient {
    @GetMapping("/api/data")
    Mono<String> fetchData();
}
```

#### Maven Dependency
Ensure you have the required dependencies in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker with Resilience4J -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-reactor-resilience4j</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Spring Cloud LoadBalancer -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Feign Client -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Service Class with Programmatic Fallback

Use `ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory` to programmatically apply a fallback mechanism:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final RemoteServiceClient remoteServiceClient;
    private final ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory circuitBreakerFactory;
    private final ReactiveCircuitBreaker circuitBreaker;

    public MyService(RemoteServiceClient remoteServiceClient, ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory circuitBreakerFactory) {
        this.remoteServiceClient = remoteServiceClient;
        this.circuitBreakerFactory = circuitBreakerFactory;
        this.circuitBreaker = circuitBreakerFactory.create("remoteServiceClient");
    }

    public Mono<String> getDataWithFallback() {
        return circuitBreaker.run(
                remoteServiceClient.fetchData(),
                throwable -> Mono.just("Fallback response due to error")
        );
    }
}
```

#### Configuration in `application.yml`

Customize the Circuit Breaker settings:

```yaml
resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    instances:
      remoteServiceClient:
        register-health-indicator: true
        sliding-window-size: 5
        failure-rate-threshold: 50
        wait-duration-in-open-state: 10000
        permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state: 3
```

### 2. API Gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway and LoadBalancer

#### Maven Dependency
Include necessary dependencies:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- Spring Cloud Gateway -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker with Resilience4J -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-reactor-resilience4j</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Spring Cloud LoadBalancer -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Configuration for Gateway
Configure the API Gateway with a circuit breaker and fallback:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: remote-service
          uri: lb://REMOTE-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/api/data
          filters:
            - name: CircuitBreaker
              args:
                name: remoteServiceCircuitBreaker
                fallbackUri: forward:/fallback

resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    instances:
      remoteServiceCircuitBreaker:
        register-health-indicator: true
        sliding-window-size: 5
        failure-rate-threshold: 50
        wait-duration-in-open-state: 10000
        permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state: 3
```

#### Fallback Controller
Implement a fallback controller for handling fallback logic:

```java
@RestController
public class FallbackController {

    @GetMapping("/fallback")
    public Mono<String> fallback() {
        return Mono.just("Fallback response for API Gateway");
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code Components

- **Service Class with Programmatic Fallback**: 
  Uses the `ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory` to create a `ReactiveCircuitBreaker` and applies a fallback mechanism. This approach enables handling fallback programmatically without modifying the original Feign client.

- **API Gateway Configuration (`application.yml`)**: 
  Configures the `CircuitBreaker` filter for specific routes and provides a fallback URI to handle failures, directing the request to a fallback endpoint.

- **Fallback Controller**: 
  Implements a fallback mechanism to return a predefined response when a fallback is triggered.
