# Rate Limiting

**Categorization: Proactive**
Rate limiting is categorized as a proactive strategy because it involves preventing problems before they occur by controlling the rate at which requests are processed. Instead of reacting to excessive load or abuse, rate limiting proactively manages and restricts the number of requests that can be handled in a given time frame.

**How It Works:**
Rate limiting works by setting a maximum number of requests that a client can make to a service within a specified period. If a client exceeds this limit, the service either delays the request until the limit resets or rejects it altogether. This prevents a single client from overwhelming the system and helps ensure fair usage among multiple clients.

**Sample Application in Real Life:**
- **API Rate Limiting:** For a public API that provides data or services, rate limiting is used to restrict the number of requests a user or application can make in an hour. For instance, a weather API might limit requests to 1000 per hour per API key. This ensures that no single user can consume excessive resources or degrade the performance for others.

**Parameters Required:**
- **Request Limit:** The maximum number of requests allowed in a specified time frame.
- **Time Window:** The duration over which the request limit is calculated (e.g., per minute, per hour).
- **Request Method:** Whether the limit is applied to all requests or specific types (e.g., GET, POST).
- **Quota Enforcement:** Actions to take when limits are exceeded (e.g., return an error, throttle requests).

**Considerations:**
- **Granularity:** Decide whether to apply rate limits at the global level (e.g., for the whole API) or at a more granular level (e.g., per user, per IP address).
- **Dynamic Limits:** Some systems adjust limits based on the system's current load or other factors.
- **User Feedback:** Provide clear feedback to users when their requests are limited, including information on when they can retry.

## Sample Usage

#### API Gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway and LoadBalancer

To apply rate limiting in an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway, use the `Resilience4j` rate limiter to control traffic to downstream services. The following shows how to implement the *Token Bucket Algorithm* based rate limiting.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1. **Add Maven Dependency:**

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-reactor-resilience4j</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Not required if not using the token bucket algorithm -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis-reactive</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

```

2. **Create a Gateway Filter Configuration:**

   Define a filter to apply rate limiting on specific routes.

   ```java
   import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.ratelimit.KeyResolver;
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
   import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

   @Configuration
   public class RateLimiterKeyResolver {

       @Bean
       public KeyResolver userKeyResolver() {
           return exchange -> Mono.just(exchange.getRequest().getRemoteAddress().getHostName());
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Configure Rate Limiting with Custom KeyResolver:**

   Use `KeyResolver` to set rate limits based on the client's IP address or other criteria.

   ```yaml
    spring:
    cloud:
        gateway:
        routes:
        - id: requestratelimiter_route
            uri: https://example.org
            filters:
            - name: RequestRateLimiter
              args:
                redis-rate-limiter.replenishRate: 10
                redis-rate-limiter.burstCapacity: 20
                redis-rate-limiter.requestedTokens: 1
                key-resolver: "#{@userKeyResolver}"
   ```

**Explanation of Code Components:**

- **`KeyResolver`**: Determines how the rate limit is applied, e.g., by IP address.
- **`RequestRateLimiter`**: Gateway filter for applying rate limiting on routes.
- The `redis-rate-limiter.replenishRate` property defines how many requests per second to allow (without any dropped requests). This is the rate at which the token bucket is filled.
- The `redis-rate-limiter.burstCapacity` property is the maximum number of requests a user is allowed in a single second (without any dropped requests). This is the number of tokens the token bucket can hold. Setting this value to zero blocks all requests.
- The `redis-rate-limiter.requestedTokens` property is how many tokens a request costs. This is the number of tokens taken from the bucket for each request and defaults to 1.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement rate limiting in both a microservice using Feign clients and an API gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway.
