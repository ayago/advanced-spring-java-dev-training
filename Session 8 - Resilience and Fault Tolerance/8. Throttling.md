# Throttling

## Categorization: Proactive
Throttling is considered a proactive strategy because it involves controlling the rate at which requests are processed before they even reach the backend services. By imposing limits on request rates, throttling aims to prevent overloading systems and ensures that services remain responsive and stable under high load conditions.

## How the Strategy Works

Throttling works by setting limits on the number of requests a service can handle over a specific period of time. These limits can be applied at various levels, such as:

- **Service Level**: Restricting the number of requests a particular service can process.
- **API Level**: Limiting the number of requests to a specific API endpoint.
- **Client Level**: Controlling the request rate for different clients or users.

The mechanism typically involves maintaining a count of requests and timestamps to determine if the current request rate exceeds the predefined threshold. If the rate exceeds the limit, additional requests may be delayed or rejected.

## Sample Application in Real Life

A common real-life application of throttling is in APIs provided by cloud services. For example, a cloud storage service might throttle requests to its API to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage among all users. If a user exceeds the allowed number of API calls per minute, the service will respond with a rate-limiting error, instructing the user to retry after a delay.

## Parameters Required to Make It Work

1. **Request Limit**: The maximum number of requests allowed within a specific time window (e.g., 1000 requests per minute).

2. **Time Window**: The duration during which the request limit is enforced (e.g., 1 minute, 1 hour).

3. **Request Counting Mechanism**: The method used to count and track requests, such as in-memory counters, distributed caches, or databases.

4. **Response Handling**: The strategy for handling requests that exceed the limit, including returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) and implementing retry policies.

5. **Configuration and Monitoring**: Tools and configurations to manage and monitor throttling rules, including setting up alerts for when throttling thresholds are approached or exceeded.
