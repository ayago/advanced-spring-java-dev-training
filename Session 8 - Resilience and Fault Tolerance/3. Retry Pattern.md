# Retry Pattern

**Categorization: Proactive**
The Retry Pattern is categorized as proactive because it involves taking action before a failure has a significant impact. The goal is to handle transient faults by automatically retrying a failed operation, based on a predefined policy. This approach anticipates that some failures might be temporary and can be resolved by retrying the operation.

**How It Works:**
The Retry Pattern involves configuring a set of rules for retrying an operation when it fails. These rules typically include:
- **Retry Count:** The number of times the operation should be retried before giving up.
- **Backoff Strategy:** The delay between retries, which could be fixed or incremental. This helps prevent overwhelming the service with retries in rapid succession.
- **Retryable Exceptions:** The types of exceptions that trigger a retry. Typically, these are transient errors, such as network timeouts or temporary unavailability of a service.

When an operation fails and triggers an exception that matches the retryable criteria, the system waits for the specified backoff duration and then retries the operation. This process continues until either the operation succeeds or the maximum retry count is reached.

**Sample Application in Real Life:**
Consider a microservice that calls an external API for data retrieval. If the external API experiences a temporary issue or network glitch, the Retry Pattern can be employed to retry the request a few times before reporting a failure. This ensures that temporary issues do not lead to immediate failure in the microservice, improving overall resilience.

**Parameters Required to Make It Work:**
- **Retry Count:** Number of retry attempts to make before giving up.
- **Backoff Strategy:** Defines how the retry delay is calculated, such as fixed delay, exponential backoff, etc.
- **Exception Types:** A list of exceptions that should trigger a retry.
- **Timeouts:** Optionally, timeouts can be set for how long to wait for each retry and how long to wait in total before considering the retry attempts exhausted.

In summary, the Retry Pattern is a proactive strategy designed to handle transient errors by automatically retrying operations based on configurable rules, enhancing the resilience and fault tolerance of microservices.
