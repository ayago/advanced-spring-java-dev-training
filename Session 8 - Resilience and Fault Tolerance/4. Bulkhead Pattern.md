# Bulkhead Pattern

## Categorization: Proactive
The Bulkhead Pattern is considered proactive because it involves designing the system to prevent failures from propagating and affecting other parts of the system. By isolating different components or services into separate bulkheads, the system is proactively prepared to handle potential failures within specific segments.

## How It Works

The Bulkhead Pattern works by dividing a system into isolated sections (or bulkheads) to ensure that failures in one section do not impact the entire system. Each bulkhead operates independently, with its own resources and limits. If one bulkhead experiences a failure or performance degradation, the other bulkheads continue to function normally, thereby containing the impact of the failure.

In a microservices architecture, this often means isolating different services or components so that issues in one service do not bring down others. For example, if you have a service responsible for handling payments and another for handling notifications, a failure in the payment service should not affect the notification service.

## Sample Application in Real Life

Consider an online e-commerce platform that includes several microservices: order management, payment processing, inventory management, and customer notifications. 

- **Without Bulkheads**: If the payment processing service experiences high load and crashes, it could potentially affect the entire e-commerce platform, causing issues with order management, inventory checks, and notifications.

- **With Bulkheads**: By implementing bulkheads, you isolate the payment processing service so that its failure only affects payment processing. Order management, inventory management, and customer notifications continue to function normally, ensuring that the platform remains operational even if payment processing is temporarily disrupted.

## Parameters Required to Make It Work

1. **Service Segmentation**: Identify and define the boundaries between different components or services in your system that can be isolated into separate bulkheads.

2. **Resource Allocation**: Allocate separate resources (e.g., thread pools, database connections) to each bulkhead to ensure that they do not compete with each other and that failures in one bulkhead do not deplete resources for others.

3. **Isolation Mechanisms**: Implement mechanisms to manage and monitor the isolation between bulkheads. This might include setting up independent failure detection and recovery procedures for each bulkhead.

4. **Configuration Limits**: Define configuration limits for each bulkhead, such as maximum concurrent requests or resource usage limits, to ensure that failures do not spill over into other parts of the system.

5. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to track the health and performance of each bulkhead separately. This helps in detecting issues early and taking corrective actions without affecting other bulkheads.

By employing the Bulkhead Pattern, you can enhance the resilience and fault tolerance of your microservices architecture, ensuring that failures are contained and do not impact the overall system's functionality.

## Types of Bulkheads

The decision to use a **Bulkhead** based on a semaphore (concurrency-limiting Bulkhead) or a **Thread Pool Bulkhead** (based on a thread pool) depends on the nature of your workload, the behavior of your application, and the specific requirements for managing concurrency and isolating failures.

### When to Use Bulkhead (Semaphore-Based)

A **semaphore-based Bulkhead** is ideal when:

1. **Non-Blocking Workloads:**
   - You are working with non-blocking or reactive code (e.g., using Project Reactor or RxJava).
   - The operations you want to protect are I/O-bound and non-blocking, such as HTTP calls with WebClient or database queries using R2DBC.

2. **Limited Concurrency Control:**
   - You want to limit the number of concurrent calls to a specific service or resource without introducing additional threads.
   - You need lightweight concurrency management without the overhead of thread pools.

3. **Minimal Overhead:**
   - Semaphore-based Bulkheads introduce minimal overhead since they only use a counting mechanism (semaphores) to control the number of concurrent calls.
   - Suitable for scenarios where you want to maintain performance and avoid the cost of context switching between threads.

4. **Higher Throughput:**
   - If your workload is highly parallel and involves small, non-blocking tasks, a semaphore-based Bulkhead can achieve higher throughput compared to a thread pool.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Protecting an HTTP endpoint that uses a non-blocking WebClient.
- Limiting access to a shared resource, like a rate-limited API, in a reactive microservice.

### When to Use Thread Pool Bulkhead

A **Thread Pool Bulkhead** is suitable when:

1. **Blocking Workloads:**
   - You are dealing with blocking code that cannot be made non-blocking, such as a blocking database driver, synchronous HTTP calls, or legacy code that cannot be refactored.
   - The workload involves operations that block the current thread, like traditional Feign clients, JDBC, or synchronous REST calls.

2. **Isolating Blocking Calls:**
   - You want to isolate blocking calls in their own dedicated thread pool to prevent them from blocking the main application threads (e.g., reactive event loop threads).
   - The thread pool provides a safety net by preventing blocking calls from overwhelming core resources or causing starvation of reactive or non-blocking tasks.

3. **Managing Resource Consumption:**
   - You need fine-grained control over the number of threads dedicated to handling specific tasks, such as configuring the maximum and minimum thread pool sizes, queue capacities, and keep-alive durations.
   - Useful in scenarios where blocking I/O tasks need to be managed independently of the main thread pool to ensure efficient resource utilization.

4. **Avoiding Cascading Failures:**
   - Thread Pool Bulkheads prevent cascading failures by isolating failures to specific thread pools. If a thread pool is exhausted, it won't affect other parts of the application.

**Example Use Cases:**
- A microservice using a blocking Feign client to call another service.
- Integrating with a legacy API or library that requires synchronous, blocking I/O.
- Protecting a blocking operation that could potentially cause thread starvation or block event loop threads.

### Choosing the Right Bulkhead

- **Use Semaphore-Based Bulkhead** when:
  - Your service is reactive and uses non-blocking I/O.
  - You want minimal overhead and do not need to manage a thread pool.

- **Use Thread Pool Bulkhead** when:
  - Your service makes blocking calls or integrates with blocking libraries.
  - You need to manage thread consumption explicitly and protect reactive threads from being blocked.

## Sample Usage

To leverage a **Thread Pool Bulkhead** via `ReactiveCircuitBreaker` in your existing code, we need to make some modifications to integrate a `ReactiveCircuitBreaker` that applies the Bulkhead pattern. This ensures that calls to the blocking Feign client are handled correctly while maintaining resilience.

### Modified Code to Use Bulkhead via `ReactiveCircuitBreaker`

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your code to leverage the Bulkhead pattern using `ReactiveCircuitBreaker`:

1. **Maven dependency**

    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

2. **Define a Bulkhead Configuration:**
   Use a custom `ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory` to configure a `ThreadPoolBulkhead`.

3. **Apply `ReactiveCircuitBreaker` in the Service:**
   Integrate `ReactiveCircuitBreaker` to wrap the blocking call to the Feign client.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.ReactiveCircuitBreaker;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;
import reactor.core.scheduler.Schedulers;
import io.github.resilience4j.bulkhead.ThreadPoolBulkheadConfig;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.Customizer;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import java.time.Duration;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;

@Service
@LoadBalancerClient(name = "product-management", configuration = ProductManagementLoadBalancerConfiguration.class)
public class ProductManagementClientBasedProductService implements ProductService {

    private final ProductManagementClient productManagementClient;
    private final ReactiveCircuitBreaker productManagementCircuitBreaker;

    @Autowired
    public ProductManagementClientBasedProductService(ProductManagementClient productManagementClient,
                                                      ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory<?> circuitBreakerFactory) {
        this.productManagementClient = productManagementClient;
        this.productManagementCircuitBreaker = circuitBreakerFactory.create("productManagementBulkhead");
    }

    @Override
    public Mono<Product> getProductWithCode(String code) {
        return getResponseEntityMono(code)
            .flatMap(entity -> Mono.fromSupplier(entity::getBody))
            .map(pmProduct -> new Product(pmProduct.getProductCode()));
    }

    private Mono<ResponseEntity<ProductDetailsResponse>> getResponseEntityMono(String code) {
        return Mono.fromCallable(() -> productManagementClient.getProduct(code))
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
            .transformDeferred(productManagementCircuitBreaker::run);
    }
}
```

### Configuration for `ThreadPoolBulkhead`

Create a configuration class to define and customize the Bulkhead pattern using `ThreadPoolBulkheadConfig`.

```java
@Configuration
public class BulkheadConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public Customizer<ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory> reactiveCircuitBreakerFactoryCustomizer() {
        return factory -> factory.configure(builder -> builder
            .bulkheadConfig(ThreadPoolBulkheadConfig.custom()
                .coreThreadPoolSize(10)  // Minimum number of threads in the pool
                .maxThreadPoolSize(20)   // Maximum number of threads in the pool
                .queueCapacity(50)       // Maximum number of tasks in the queue
                .keepAliveDuration(Duration.ofMillis(500))
                .build()), "productManagementBulkhead");
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **ReactiveCircuitBreaker Integration:**
   The `ReactiveCircuitBreaker` is created for the "productManagementBulkhead" using a `ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory`. The `ReactiveCircuitBreaker` is used to wrap the call to the Feign client with a Bulkhead pattern.

2. **Transform Deferred Execution:**
   The `transformDeferred` method is applied to the `Mono` returned by `getResponseEntityMono`. This ensures that the Bulkhead pattern is applied to the Feign client's call, protecting the reactive thread pool from being blocked.

3. **Thread Pool Bulkhead Configuration:**
   The `ThreadPoolBulkheadConfig` is defined with settings for the thread pool's size, queue capacity, and thread keep-alive duration. The `Customizer` is used to configure the `ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory` to use these settings for the "productManagementBulkhead".

### Benefits of this Approach

- **Thread Isolation:** Ensures that blocking calls to the Feign client do not consume core threads, allowing the application to remain responsive.
- **Resilience and Fault Tolerance:** Leverages the Bulkhead pattern to prevent cascading failures by isolating failures in the Feign client.
- **Reactive Programming Model:** Integrates smoothly with the reactive programming model provided by Project Reactor and Spring WebFlux.

By applying these changes, you can achieve a resilient design that efficiently manages blocking operations while adhering to the principles of reactive programming.
