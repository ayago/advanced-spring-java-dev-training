# Resilience and Fault Tolerance in Microservices

## 1. Circuit Breaker

**Description:**
The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents a service from making repeated requests to a failing service, thus avoiding a cascade of failures. It operates in three states: Closed (normal operation), Open (service is failing), and Half-Open (testing if the service has recovered).

**Key Points:**
- **Closed State:** Requests are passed through to the service. If failures occur beyond a threshold, the circuit breaker trips to the Open state.
- **Open State:** Requests are blocked, and a fallback response is provided. After a timeout period, the circuit breaker moves to the Half-Open state.
- **Half-Open State:** A limited number of requests are allowed to test if the service has recovered. If successful, the circuit breaker returns to the Closed state; otherwise, it returns to the Open state.

## 2. Retry

**Description:**
The Retry pattern involves automatically retrying a failed operation a specified number of times before giving up. It is used to handle transient failures that might resolve on their own.

**Key Points:**
- **Retry Policy:** Defines the number of retry attempts, the delay between attempts, and conditions under which retries are made.
- **Backoff Strategy:** A strategy for managing the delay between retry attempts, which can be constant, exponential, or based on a custom function.

## 3. Rate Limiting

**Description:**
Rate Limiting restricts the number of requests a service can handle within a certain timeframe to prevent overloading. It helps in controlling traffic and ensuring fair usage.

**Key Points:**
- **Fixed Window:** Limits requests in a fixed time period, such as per minute or per hour.
- **Sliding Window:** Provides more granular control by adjusting the window size dynamically.
- **Token Bucket:** Allows a certain number of requests to be processed immediately, with excess requests being queued or denied based on token availability.

## 4. Bulkhead

**Description:**
The Bulkhead pattern isolates failures to a specific part of the system to prevent them from affecting the entire system. It allocates separate resources, such as thread pools or service instances, for different components.

**Key Points:**
- **Resource Isolation:** Different components or services operate in isolated resource pools, so a failure in one does not impact others.
- **Failure Containment:** Limits the impact of failures to isolated sections, enhancing overall system stability and reliability.

## 5. Timeout

**Description:**
The Timeout pattern ensures that a service call does not hang indefinitely by specifying a maximum time limit for the operation. This helps in recovering from unresponsive services and improving system resilience.

**Key Points:**
- **Fixed Timeout:** Sets a constant timeout duration for operations.
- **Adaptive Timeout:** Adjusts the timeout duration based on the systemâ€™s current load and performance.
