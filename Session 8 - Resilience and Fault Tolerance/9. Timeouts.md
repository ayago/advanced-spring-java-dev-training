# Timeouts

## Categorization: Proactive
Timeouts are considered a proactive strategy because they are implemented in advance to handle potential issues before they occur. By setting timeouts, you define maximum limits for how long a service should wait for a response from another service. This prevents the system from being blocked indefinitely and ensures that resources are managed effectively.

## How It Works

Timeouts are used to specify the maximum duration a system or service will wait for an operation to complete before aborting and taking an alternative action. In the context of microservices:

- **Request Timeouts:** Define how long a service will wait for a response from another service. If the response is not received within this time frame, the request is aborted, and an error is typically returned.
  
- **Connection Timeouts:** Specify the maximum time allowed for establishing a connection to another service. If the connection is not established within this period, an error is thrown.

Timeouts are essential to prevent services from hanging or becoming unresponsive due to slow or unresponsive dependencies. They help in maintaining system performance and reliability by ensuring that calls do not wait indefinitely.

## Sample Application in Real Life

Consider an e-commerce platform with a microservices architecture. One of the microservices handles payment processing, which involves making an external API call to a payment gateway. To ensure that the platform remains responsive and doesnâ€™t get stuck if the payment gateway is slow or unresponsive, the payment service can be configured with a timeout. For example, if the payment gateway does not respond within 5 seconds, the payment service will timeout and either retry the request, fail gracefully, or notify the user of the issue.

## Parameters Required

To effectively implement timeouts, the following parameters need to be configured:

1. **Connection Timeout:** The time period allowed to establish a connection to the target service.
   
2. **Read Timeout:** The maximum duration to wait for a response once the connection has been established.
   
3. **Write Timeout:** The time allowed to write data to the target service before timing out.
   
4. **Retry Policy:** How many times and how often to retry a failed operation before giving up.

## Sample Usage:

### 1. Microservice with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer and Feign Client

#### Code Example

**Feign Client Configuration:**

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.openfeign.FeignClient;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@FeignClient(name = "product-service", configuration = FeignConfig.class)
public interface ProductServiceClient {
    @GetMapping("/products")
    Mono<String> getProducts();
}
```

**Feign Client Configuration Class:**

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.cloud.openfeign.FeignClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.ReactiveCircuitBreaker;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.ReactiveCircuitBreakerRegistry;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.ReactiveCircuitBreakerCustomizer;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.Resilience4JCircuitBreakerFactory;

@Configuration
public class FeignConfig {

    @Bean
    public ReactiveCircuitBreakerCustomizer circuitBreakerCustomizer() {
        return (factory) -> factory.configureDefault(
            id -> new Resilience4JCircuitBreakerFactory()
                    .create(id)
                    .configure(c -> c.timeoutDuration(Duration.ofSeconds(3))) // 3 seconds timeout
        );
    }
}
```

**Service Class:**

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

@Service
public class ProductService {

    @Autowired
    private ProductServiceClient productServiceClient;

    public Mono<String> getProducts() {
        return productServiceClient.getProducts()
            .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3)) // Timeout after 3 seconds
            .onErrorResume(throwable -> Mono.just("Fallback response"));
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feign Client Configuration (`ProductServiceClient`):** Defines the Feign client interface for the `product-service`.
2. **Feign Config Class (`FeignConfig`):** Configures a `ReactiveCircuitBreakerCustomizer` that applies a 3-second timeout to Feign clients.
3. **Service Class (`ProductService`):** Uses the Feign client to make a call with a timeout and a fallback mechanism in case of timeout or other errors.

### 2. API Gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway and Spring Cloud LoadBalancer

#### Code Example

**API Gateway Configuration:**

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: product-service
          uri: lb://product-service
          predicates:
            - Path=/products/**
          filters:
            - name: Timeout
              args:
                responseTimeout: 3s
                setStatusOnTimeout: true
```

**Configuration Class:**

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.config.GatewayProperties;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.factory.RequestRateLimiterGatewayFilterFactory;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.factory.RequestRateLimiterGatewayFilterFactory.Config;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@Configuration
public class GatewayConfig {

    @Bean
    public RequestRateLimiterGatewayFilterFactory rateLimiter() {
        return new RequestRateLimiterGatewayFilterFactory();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **API Gateway Configuration (`application.yml`):** Configures a route to the `product-service` with a 3-second timeout using the `Timeout` filter. The `lb://` scheme indicates that Spring Cloud LoadBalancer should be used.
2. **Configuration Class (`GatewayConfig`):** Adds a bean for rate limiting. Although not directly related to timeouts, it's useful for managing traffic and should be considered alongside timeouts.
