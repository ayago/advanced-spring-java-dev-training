# Circuit Breaker Pattern

## Categorization: Reactive
The Circuit Breaker Pattern is categorized as a reactive strategy because it is designed to handle failures and prevent cascading failures in a system after a problem has been detected. It reacts to failures by preventing calls to a failing service and providing fallback mechanisms.

> It is hard to categorize the circuit breaker because it is pro- and reactive at the same time. It detects that a given downstream system is malfunctioning (reactive) and it protects the upstream systems from transient errors (proactive).

## How It Works
The Circuit Breaker Pattern works by monitoring the interactions with a service. It is based on three states:

1. **Closed**: The circuit breaker allows all requests to pass through to the service. If the failure rate exceeds a predefined threshold, the circuit breaker transitions to the Open state.
   
2. **Open**: The circuit breaker rejects all requests to the service, and the system immediately returns a fallback response or error. During this state, it periodically transitions to the Half-Open state to test if the service has recovered.

3. **Half-Open**: The circuit breaker allows a limited number of requests to pass through to test if the service has recovered. If these requests succeed, the circuit breaker transitions back to the Closed state. If they fail, it goes back to the Open state.

The goal is to avoid making requests to a failing service and to allow it time to recover, thus improving the systemâ€™s overall resilience.

## Sample Application in Real Life
Imagine an e-commerce application with a microservice architecture. The order service relies on a payment service to process transactions. If the payment service starts failing or becomes too slow, the circuit breaker will open, preventing the order service from making further requests to the payment service. Instead, the order service can return a fallback response, such as notifying the user of the issue or using a temporary offline payment method.

## Parameters Required
- **Failure Threshold**: The rate of failures or errors at which the circuit breaker should transition from Closed to Open. 
- **Timeout Duration**: The period the circuit breaker will wait before transitioning from Open to Half-Open.
- **Success Threshold**: The number of successful requests needed in Half-Open state before transitioning back to Closed.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: The response or action to take when the circuit breaker is Open.

## Sample Implementation using Reactive Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker with Resilience4J

To implement the Circuit Breaker Pattern using `spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-reactor-resilience4j` in a microservice architecture, we'll demonstrate how to apply it to:

1. A microservice using Spring Cloud Load Balancer for client-side load balancing to connect to another microservice via Feign client.
2. An API Gateway implemented using Spring Cloud Gateway with Spring Cloud Load Balancer.

### 1. Microservice with Feign Client and Circuit Breaker

#### Step 1: Add Required Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-reactor-resilience4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Step 2: Define Feign Client Interface

Define the Feign client that communicates with another microservice:

```java
@FeignClient(name = "remoteService", url = "${remote.service.url}")
public interface RemoteServiceClient {
    @GetMapping("/api/data")
    Mono<DataResponse> getData();
}
```

#### Step 3: Inject `ReactiveCircuitBreaker` and Use It Programmatically

Create a service class where the `ReactiveCircuitBreaker` is injected and used programmatically:

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.ReactiveCircuitBreaker;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory;

@Service
public class DataService {

    private final RemoteServiceClient remoteServiceClient;
    private final ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory circuitBreakerFactory;
    private final ReactiveCircuitBreaker remoteServiceCircuitBreaker;

    @Autowired
    public DataService(RemoteServiceClient remoteServiceClient,
                       ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory circuitBreakerFactory) {
        this.remoteServiceClient = remoteServiceClient;
        this.circuitBreakerFactory = circuitBreakerFactory;
        this.remoteServiceCircuitBreaker = circuitBreakerFactory.create("remoteServiceCircuitBreaker");
    }

    public Mono<DataResponse> fetchData() {
        return remoteServiceCircuitBreaker.run(
            remoteServiceClient.getData(),
            throwable -> fallbackGetData(throwable)
        );
    }

    private Mono<DataResponse> fallbackGetData(Throwable throwable) {
        // Handle fallback logic here
        return Mono.just(new DataResponse("Fallback data"));
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Configure Resilience4J

Configure the circuit breaker properties in `application.yml`:

```yaml
resilience4j.circuitbreaker:
  instances:
    remoteServiceCircuitBreaker:
      slidingWindowSize: 10
      failureRateThreshold: 50
      waitDurationInOpenState: 5000
```

### 2. API Gateway with Circuit Breaker and Spring Cloud Load Balancer

#### Step 1: Add Required Dependencies

Add the dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-reactor-resilience4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Step 2: Configure API Gateway Routes

Define the routes in `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: remote-service
          uri: lb://remote-service
          predicates:
            - Path=/api/data/**
          filters:
            - name: CircuitBreaker
              args:
                name: remoteServiceCircuitBreaker
                fallbackUri: forward:/fallback
```

#### Step 3: Implement Fallback Logic

Create a fallback controller to handle fallback responses:

```java
@RestController
public class FallbackController {

    @GetMapping("/fallback")
    public Mono<String> fallback() {
        return Mono.just("Fallback response from API Gateway");
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Configure Resilience4J for API Gateway

Configure the Resilience4J settings in `application.yml`:

```yaml
resilience4j.circuitbreaker:
  instances:
    remoteServiceCircuitBreaker:
      slidingWindowSize: 10
      failureRateThreshold: 50
      waitDurationInOpenState: 5000
```

### Summary

- **Microservice with Feign Client**: Use `@CircuitBreaker` to wrap the Feign client method and provide fallback handling.
- **API Gateway**: Define routes with the `CircuitBreaker` filter and specify fallback URIs, with a fallback controller to manage responses.

These components ensure resilience and fault tolerance in both the microservice-to-microservice communication and the API gateway routing.
